# Understanding Smart Contracts

In Bitcoin, the only entities that participate on the blockchain are individual wallets that send payments to each other 👛. On Ethereum, there are two kinds of entities: wallets and smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that operate on top of the blockchain and can act as standalone entities, interacting with wallets and other smart contracts directly 🤖.
A smart contract is essentially a self-executing program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain 🔄. Smart contracts can be built and deployed on Ethereum by anyone and can be engineered to execute any kind of logic. These contracts automatically enforce and execute preprogrammed rules when specific conditions are met, without needing a middleman 🔒. For example, think of a vending machine: you put in money, select a product, and it automatically dispenses the item. Smart contracts work similarly in digital form but can be used for a much broader range of applications, from finance to gaming 🎮💹.

Smart contracts have key characteristics that differentiate them from traditional programs:

- **They are immutable:** Once deployed to the blockchain, they cannot be altered 🔒.
- **They operate autonomously:** Once set in motion, they execute without external interference 🤖.
- **They are trustless:** Users don't need to rely on any party to ensure the contract works as promised 🤝.

A core principle of Ethereum is censorship resistance 🛡️. Because Ethereum is decentralized, no single entity or government can easily shut it down or block access to its applications. Once a dApp or smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, it operates autonomously, and no one can alter or remove it without stopping the blockchain—meaning that everyone worldwide would have to stop using Ethereum 🌍. This makes Ethereum a powerful tool for creating open, transparent services that aren't controlled by any central authority—something that wasn't possible before. If someone builds a controversial service as a traditional website, it can be easily taken offline by authorities; however, if something like that is built on top of Ethereum, it's there forever without any means to censor it 🔐.
