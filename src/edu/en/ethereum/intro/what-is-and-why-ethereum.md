# What is & Why Ethereum?

While both Ethereum and Bitcoin are built on blockchain technology, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin was created to be a digital currency—a decentralized store of value and medium of exchange 💰. Ethereum, however, is a platform for building decentralized apps (dApps) 🏗️.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that allows developers to create applications that run on the blockchain, ensuring they are always online and operate exactly as programmed 🌐💻. Ethereum offers a framework for dApps, enabling them to function without the risk of fraud, censorship, or third-party interference 🛡️.

Think of Ethereum as a global, decentralized computer that anyone can use to build or interact with applications 🌍🖥️. On the traditional internet, websites and services are controlled by companies, meaning they can restrict access or ban users 🚫. On Ethereum, dApps operate under transparent, verifiable rules, free from centralized control 🔍. Once deployed, these applications run exactly as designed, offering trustless interactions between users 🤝.

In short, Ethereum was created to extend the use of blockchain technology beyond simple payment transfers to a wide range of applications 🚀. Some examples of services that can be built on Ethereum include notary services, election systems, lotteries, borrowing and lending platforms, and pretty much anything else 📄🗳️🎰💳.

Bitcoin transactions are straightforward—just sending and receiving BTC 🔄. Ethereum's transactions, on the other hand, can involve multiple steps and conditional logic that enable more advanced operations 🧩. In short, Bitcoin is focused on being a store of value, while Ethereum is designed for decentralized services 🏦🛠️.
