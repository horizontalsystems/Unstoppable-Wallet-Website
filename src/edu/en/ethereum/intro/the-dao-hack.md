# The DAO Hack


In 2016, during its early days, Ethereum faced a major crisis with the hack of "The DAO," a decentralized service built on the Ethereum platform 💥. Hackers exploited a vulnerability in The DAO's smart contract code, managing to steal millions of dollars' worth of Ether—at the time, a significant portion of the Ether in circulation 💰🦹‍♂️.

This event led to a highly controversial decision: Ethereum's community voted to reverse the hack by implementing a hard fork, effectively undoing the theft 🔄. This decision resulted in the Ethereum blockchain splitting into two: Ethereum (ETH), which reversed the hack, and Ethereum Classic (ETC), which retained the original blockchain and kept the hack intact 🍴. While this kind of hard fork was possible in Ethereum's early days, it's unlikely that such a drastic measure would be repeated today given the platform's scale and maturity 🏛️.
