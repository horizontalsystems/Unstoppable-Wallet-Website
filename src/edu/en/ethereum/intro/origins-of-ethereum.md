# Origins of Ethereum

Ethereum was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, along with a team of co-founders, in response to the limitations of Bitcoin 🚀. While Bitcoin was primarily designed as a decentralized form of money 💰, Ethereum was developed to go beyond just payments.

The idea was to create a platform that allowed people to build decentralized applications (dApps) 🏗️— automated services that run on the blockchain without central control 🤖.

In 2014, Ethereum held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 💼, allowing people to purchase Ether (ETH) tokens to fund the development of the platform. The Ethereum team raised roughly $18.3 million worth of Bitcoin 💸 in the token sale, which was more than 31,500 BTC at the time of the ICO.

Unlike Bitcoin, which had no pre-sale or funding round 🚫💰, Ethereum's ICO allowed early supporters to buy into the project before its official launch 🎬.

While this helped Ethereum grow quickly 📈, some Bitcoin enthusiasts have criticized the ICO model, arguing that it goes against Bitcoin's decentralized, organic launch 🌱. In this sense, the launch of Ethereum resembled a traditional IPO 📊.
