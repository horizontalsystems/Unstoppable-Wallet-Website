# Enhancing Privacy

While Ethereum isn’t inherently private, there are ways to improve your privacy:

- **Avoid Sharing Publicly**: Don’t share your Ethereum address or ENS name (Ethereum Name Service) on public platforms like social media. Your Twitter activity combined with Ethereum transactions can reveal a lot of information that you have no intended to share.

- **Use Multiple Wallets**: Separate wallets for different purposes can help. For example, keep a savings wallet with large balances isolated and use it only for transfers to and from exchanges. Use another wallet for daily transactions or interactions with dApps.

- **Use Exchange Deposit Addresses**: For occasional incoming transfers, you can give out a deposit address on a crypto exchange account, rather than your personal wallet address, to prevent linking your activity.
 
- **Be Mindful During KYC**: When verifying your identity on cryptocurrency exchanges, avoid providing unnecessary sensitive information. Exchanges and KYC providers can be hacked, exposing your data.

- **Avoid Linking Wallets**: Avoid sending transactions between your wallets, as this links them and reduces privacy. If you need to top up a wallet, use an exchange as an intermediary.

- **Separate Wallets for Risky Interactions**: If you plan to interact with dApps and various blockchain services on a regular basis, create a separate wallet for these transactions to isolate them from your main wallet.

**Note**: While these steps can enhance privacy, achieving complete anonymity requires more advanced techniques, which are outside the scope of this guide.
