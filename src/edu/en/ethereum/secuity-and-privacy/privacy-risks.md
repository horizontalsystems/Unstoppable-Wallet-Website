# **Privacy Risks**

Ethereum’s privacy model is different from Bitcoin’s. While Bitcoin users can use new addresses for each transaction to enhance privacy, Ethereum wallets typically rely on a single address. This has several implications:

- **Public Transaction History**: Anyone who knows your Ethereum address can see your entire transaction history, token balances, and interactions with decentralized apps (dApps). For instance, if you share your address to receive payment, the sender can see all your activity tied to that address.

- **Identity Linkage**: If you use Ethereum on platforms that require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, such as centralized exchanges, your identity is tied to your address. This means exchanges that collect KYC data know both your on-chain activity and your real-world identity.

- -**Wallet Isolation**: The privacy of one cryptocurrency in a wallet doesn’t affect the others. For example, while your Ethereum activity might be public, your Bitcoin holdings in the same wallet remain private. There’s no way for someone to infer your Bitcoin balance from your Ethereum address.

**Key Reminder**: Everything you do on Ethereum is permanent and public. Unlike web activity, blockchain data doesn’t disappear or get deleted, meaning it could be used against you in the future.
