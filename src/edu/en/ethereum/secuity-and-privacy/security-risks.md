# Security Risks

Ethereum brings unique security risks, in addition to standard precautions like keeping your mnemonic phrase private and ensuring secure backups. Below are the key risks to be aware of:

**Smart Contract Hacks**
dApps are powered by smart contracts, which are trustless but can sometimes contain bugs or vulnerabilities. Malicious actors can exploit these flaws to steal funds. Once funds are lost due to a hack, recovery is almost impossible. Always research a dApp’s history and audit status before using it.

**Rug Pulls**

Some dApps are created with malicious intent. Developers may promote a dApp to attract users and funds, then withdraw those funds from the smart contract and disappear. These scams are often referred to as "rug pulls." To protect yourself:

- Verify the team behind the dApp.
- Check if the smart contract has admin privileges that allow unrestricted access to funds.
- Look for audits or reviews from trusted sources.
  
**Phishing Attacks**

Phishing attacks are one of the most common threats in the Ethereum ecosystem. Always double-check URLs and ensure you are using the legitimate service rather than a malicious imitation. Here are some specific examples:

- **MetaMask Targeting**: Scammers may trick users into revealing signing unauthorized transactions. Avoid signing transactions if you don’t fully understand them, and use wallets with minimal funds for testing dApps.
- **WalletConnect Targeting**: Fake dApps can exploit WalletConnect to trick users into signing malicious transactions. The rule of thumb is to only use WalletConnect on trusted websites or services you are certain about.

**Address Poisoning Attacks**

In this tactic, attackers send tiny amounts of ETH or other token or tokens to your wallet from an address that looks very similar to one you’ve interacted with before. The goal is to confuse you into sending funds to their fake address. This works because users usually interact with the same addresses over and over (i.e. deposit to crypto exchange account) and typically copy the address from transactions history. Always double-check the recipient address before confirming a transaction.
