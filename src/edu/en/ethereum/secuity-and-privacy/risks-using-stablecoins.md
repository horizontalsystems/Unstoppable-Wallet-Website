# Risks Using Stablecoins

Stablecoins are among the most popular tokens on Ethereum. They address one of crypto’s biggest challenges: volatility, by maintaining a steady value, typically pegged to a traditional currency like the US Dollar. However, they come with distinct risks:

**USDT (Tether)**

- **Centralized Control**: Managed by Tether Limited, USDT operates under centralized oversight. Its smart contract includes administrative functions, such as freezing balances or blocking transactions—even in non-custodial wallets.
- **Trust Required**: Users must rely on Tether Limited to maintain sufficient USD reserves to back the stablecoin. Its value depends heavily on the company’s banking relationships and regulatory compliance.
- **Censorship Risk**: Tether Limited can freeze USDT holdings at any time, posing a risk to users in certain jurisdictions or situations.

**Important Note:** Holding large USDT balances long-term is not advisable, particularly for businesses like crypto exchange bureaus. Even a single interaction with a flagged user can result in your account being frozen due to anti-money laundering systems.

**DAI**

- **Decentralized**: Created by MakerDAO, DAI operates without a central authority. No one can freeze your DAI or block transactions.
- **Crypto-Backed**: DAI maintains its $1 value through collateral held in smart contracts, primarily ETH.
- **Transparent**: DAI’s mechanisms are fully on-chain, meaning anyone can verify how it works.

While DAI offers stronger censorship resistance, it’s less widely supported by exchanges compared to USDT. This limits its accessibility in certain scenarios.

**Key Takeaway**

USDT remains the most popular stablecoin but comes with significant risks tied to its centralized nature, including censorship and reliance on Tether Limited. On the other hand, DAI provides greater privacy and censorship resistance, making it a better choice for users concerned about these risks.
