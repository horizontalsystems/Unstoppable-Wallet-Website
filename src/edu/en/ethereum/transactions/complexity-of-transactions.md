# Complexity of Transactions

Not all transactions on Ethereum are alike. Some are straightforward, like sending ETH from one address to another, which involves just a single step.

However, many transactions are more complex, especially those that involve interaction with decentralized apps (dApps) or smart contracts. For example, if you’re using a decentralized exchange (DEX) to swap tokens, a single transaction can trigger multiple steps—each managed automatically by Ethereum. Although complex behind the scenes, these actions are presented as one transaction to users, with Ethereum handling all steps in the background.

More complex transactions take more computational resources on the side of validators and therefore more expensive to process. For instance a transaction, that may involve using some storage space on blockchain or perform extensive computation will be very expensive.
