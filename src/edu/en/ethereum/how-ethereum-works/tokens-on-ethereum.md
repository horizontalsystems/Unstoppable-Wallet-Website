# Tokens on Ethereum: ERC-20 & NFTs

Ethereum is much more than its native currency, Ether (ETH). One of its standout features is the ability to create and manage tokens that represent different assets or utilities on the blockchain. These tokens are controlled by smart contracts and can be programmed by developers to serve specific purposes.

For example, a token could represent a lottery entry, or give governance rights in a decentralized app (dApp). Two of the most widely used token types on Ethereum are **ERC-20 tokens** and **NFTs.**

## ERC-20 Tokens

ERC-20 tokens follow a widely-used standard that ensures all tokens created using this standard behave in a predictable manner. The common standard ensures that developers are able to build software apps (i.e. wallet apps, smart contracts) that can handle all tokens equally, rather than creating a separate wallet for each token. Also, tokens that follow ERC-20 standard are interchangeable, just like dollars, where one dollar is no different from another dollar. 

Stablecoins like **USDT** or **DAI**, which are tied to the value of traditional currencies, and governance tokens like **UNI**, which grant users the right to participate in decision-making on Uniswap DEX(decentralized token exchange), are common examples of ERC-20 tokens. 

These tokens can easily be transferred between Ethereum wallets and are compatible with a wide range of Ethereum-based apps and services, making them highly versatile and widely accepted across the network.

## NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique tokens that represent one-of-a-kind assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike ERC-20 tokens, NFTs are not interchangeable, as each token is distinct. 

NFTs have gained significant popularity in industries like digital art, collectibles, and gaming, where proving ownership of unique digital items is essential.

NFTs can be used to represent anything from digital artwork to virtual real estate, and ownership is easily verifiable on the blockchain. This transparency has made NFTs a powerful tool for creators and collectors alike, providing a secure way to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.

## Sending/Receiving ETH and ERC-20 Tokens

Tokens on Ethereum, such as **USDT**, can be stored, sent, and received just like regular cryptocurrencies, such as **ETH** or **BTC**. One key aspect of Ethereum wallets is that both **ETH**and **ERC-20**tokens share a common wallet address. This means that within the same wallet, your deposit address for ETH is the same as for any ERC-20 token, like **USDT** or **DAI**.

When sending ERC-20 tokens, it’s important to remember that **transaction fees must be paid in ETH**. This is because sending an ERC-20 token isn’t just a simple transfer—it involves interacting with the smart contract governing that specific token. For example, if you're sending **USDT**to someone, your wallet must interact with the USDT smart contract to complete the transaction, and the **gas fees** for that interaction are always paid in **ETH**.
