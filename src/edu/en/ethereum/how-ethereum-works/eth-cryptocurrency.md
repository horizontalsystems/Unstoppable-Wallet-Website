# ETH Cryptocurrency

Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform. It functions both as a digital currency and as the fuel that powers the Ethereum network. Whenever you use Ethereum—whether to send ETH or interact with smart contracts —you need to pay fees in ETH.

## Is Ethereum Inflationary or Deflationary?

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum doesn’t have a fixed supply of ETH. Instead, new ETH is created at a changing rate, depending on network activity and other factors. Initially, Ethereum created around 18 million ETH per year, but this changed after it switched to Proof of Stake (PoS).

In 2021, Ethereum introduced a system where part of the ETH used for transaction fees is **burned**, meaning it’s permanently removed from circulation. This reduces the supply, especially when there’s a lot of activity on the network.

Ethereum can be **inflationary**(when more ETH is created than burned) or **deflationary**(when more ETH is burned than created). For example, in 2024, Ethereum became inflationary because more ETH was created than burned. However, during times of high network usage, like in early 2024, Ethereum was deflationary because more ETH was burned than emitted.

Overall, whether Ethereum’s supply grows or shrinks depends on how busy the Ethereum network is and how much ETH gets burned compared to how much is created.
