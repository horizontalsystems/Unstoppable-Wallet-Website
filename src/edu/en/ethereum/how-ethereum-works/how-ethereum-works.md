# How Ethereum Blockchain Works

Both Ethereum and Bitcoin are made up of many computers all over the world, working together to maintain the blockchain and process transactions. The blockchain is a record of all transactions, and each computer has a copy of this record. To keep everything running smoothly, there needs to be a way to decide which computer will add the next set of transactions to the blockchain.

Bitcoin uses something called **Proof of Work (PoW)**. Here, thousands of computers (miners) compete to solve a hard puzzle. The first one to solve it adds the next set of transactions and gets rewarded with newly created Bitcoin and fees. The more computing power you have, the better your chances.

Ethereum used to work the same way, but now it uses something called**Proof of Stake (PoS)**. Instead of solving puzzles, people lock up (or “stake”) 32 ETH to become a validator. Validators are chosen randomly to add transactions to the blockchain, and they earn rewards in the form of ETH and fees. It’s random, so everyone who stakes has a chance.

If you don’t have 32 ETH, you can join a **staking pool**. In a pool, lots of people combine their ETH to meet the 32 ETH requirement and share the rewards. This way, even if you don’t have a lot of ETH, you can still earn rewards.
