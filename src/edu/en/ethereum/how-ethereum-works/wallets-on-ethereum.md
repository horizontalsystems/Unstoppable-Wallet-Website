# Wallets On Ethereum

To interact with Ethereum, you need a non-custodial wallet app. An Ethereum wallet is an application that allows you to store, send, and receive Ether (ETH) and other Ethereum-based tokens. Most multi-currency, non-custodial wallet apps (e.g., Unstoppable Wallet) support Ethereum, making it easy for users to manage their assets on the platform.

There are a few key things to keep in mind about Ethereum wallets:

- **Single Address System:** Unlike Bitcoin, where a new address is generated for each transaction, Ethereum wallets typically use a single address for all your transactions. This means that all your Ethereum transactions and token balances are linked to the same public address.
  
- **Types of Wallets:** Non-custodial Ethereum wallets come in various forms, including mobile apps, browser extensions, and hardware wallets. Among these, browser extension wallets are generally the least secure.

- **Interacting with dApps:** Not all wallet apps come with the ability to interact with decentralized apps (dApps). While most wallets support basic send and receive functions, only certain wallets go further by allowing you to interact with dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. This functionality is usually provided through a feature called **WalletConnect**, which securely links your wallet to dApps. Not all wallet apps comes with **WalletConnect** feature.
