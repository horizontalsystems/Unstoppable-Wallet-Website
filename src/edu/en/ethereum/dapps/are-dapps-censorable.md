# Are dApps Censorable?

While dApps are designed to be censorship-resistant, in practice, censorship is more nuanced.

Once a smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, it operates independently and cannot be restricted by any single entity. However, censorship can still occur at certain access points:

- Most users access dApps through websites, which can be taken down, blocked, or geo-restricted.
- Webiste domain names can be seized, or DNS access blocked.
- Website interfaces can be modified to prevent certain interactions.

However, even if a main dApp website is censored, users still have options:

- The smart contract remains fully functional on the blockchain.
- Alternative websites can provide access to the dApp.
- Users can interact directly with the contract through blockchain tools like block explorers.
- Tech-savvy users can access the dAppâ€™s full functionality independently.
