# What are dApps?

Decentralized applications (dApps) are programs built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts. A dApp can consist of one or more smart contracts working together to provide its features. Once a smart contract is deployed, its code is immutable—meaning it can’t be changed. This immutability ensures that a dApp will continue to operate exactly as initially programmed, giving users confidence in its reliability.

The term **"trustless"** means users don’t need to trust any individual or organization to use the application; they only need to trust the code, which is visible and verifiable on the blockchain. Anyone can review exactly how a dApp functions by examining its smart contract code.

dApps operate based on how their smart contracts are programmed:

- Some are fully autonomous, running without any central authority.
- Others have administrative features, giving specific addresses the ability to manage aspects of the dApp.
- The level of decentralization depends on design choices made by the dApp developers.

Common types of dApps include:

- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Such as Uniswap, where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly.
- **Lending Platforms**: Like Aave, where users can lend or borrow crypto assets.
