# DAOs

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent one of Ethereum's most innovative applications, demonstrating how blockchain technology can transform traditional organizational structures.

A DAO is an organization (a virtual one) that runs on rules encoded in smart contracts, eliminating the need for traditional management hierarchies. Many dApps operate in a from of a DAO.

Typically, DAOs operate through governance tokens (implemented as ERC20 tokens) that grant voting rights to members.

These tokens can typically be:

- Bought and sold on exchanges
- Acquired through contribution to the project

When decisions need to be made - whether about treasury spending, or strategic directions - token holders can vote on proposals. All votes are recorded on the blockchain, and approved decisions execute automatically through smart contracts.

Notable examples in practice:

- Uniswap: UNI token holders vote on protocol changes and fee structures
- MakerDAO: MKR holders govern the DAI stablecoin.

DAOs demonstrate Ethereum's potential for true decentralization. With no central authority, rules enforced by code rather than individuals, and community ownership, DAOs can operate continuously and transparently as long as Ethereum exists.

As the technology matures, DAOs are becoming more user-friendly and efficient, while working to address legal compliance and integration with traditional systems. They represent a fundamental shift in organizational structure, removing the need for trusted intermediaries in complex organizational processes.
