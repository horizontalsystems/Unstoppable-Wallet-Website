# Censorship in Smart Contracts

While smart contracts themselves are generally resistant to censorship, certain design choices introduced by smart contract builders can introduce control points. Infact, the dApp may be deliberately built to be restrictive from the very beginning. Nothing prevents people from building any kind of dApp they want. 

**Contract Design Choices**:

- There are many smart contracts that include restrictions, such as blacklisting features.
- Some contracts have admin usersÂ allowing certain addresses to manage functionality.
- Some stablecoin token contracts (e.g., USDT) have functions to freeze accounts.
- Some contracts can allow developers to modify or pause the contract behavior after deployment.

True censorship resistance in a dApp usually requires:

- No admin users or minimal administrative control.
- Limited or no upgradeability.
- Fully autonomous operations.
- Decentralized hosting of the website.
- Multiple access points for users.

Understanding these aspects can help users assess the true censorship resistance of any dApp they wish to use.
