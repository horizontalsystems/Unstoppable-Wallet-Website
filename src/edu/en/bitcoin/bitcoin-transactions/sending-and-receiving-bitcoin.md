# Sending and Receiving Bitcoin

Non-custodial wallets provide the user with complete control over their private keys, enabling true ownership of their Bitcoin. Unlike custodial wallets, where a third party manages the private keys, non-custodial wallets allow users to transact on Bitcoin network directly. For example, after purchasing Bitcoin on a cryptocurrency exchange like Binance, users will often transfer it to a non-custodial wallet like Unstoppable Wallet to ensure full control and security. 🔐

## Deposit/Receive Addresses and QR Codes: 📇
Every Bitcoin wallet has a unique deposit/receive address, which is a string of alphanumeric characters representing a Bitcoin address. To make transactions easier, most wallets allow users to share their address as a QR code, which can be scanned by others to initiate a transaction. For instance, if you're splitting a bill with a friend who wants to pay you in Bitcoin, they can scan the QR code of your wallet address and transfer funds easily. This is especially useful for merchants accepting Bitcoin payments. 📸💳

## Depositing/Withdrawing Bitcoin to/from an Exchange: 🏦
Depositing Bitcoin from a non-custodial wallet to a cryptocurrency exchange is simple. You need to obtain the deposit address from the exchange, input it into your non-custodial wallet, and send the transaction. Similarly, withdrawing Bitcoin from a cryptocurrency exchange to a non-custodial wallet requires copying the Bitcoin address from the non-custodial wallet and pasting it into the exchange's withdrawal field. 🔁
