# What Is Self Custody? 🔑

Once you have acquired Bitcoin, transferring it to a non-custodial wallet is the next crucial step for securing your assets. Leaving Bitcoin on an exchange leaves it vulnerable to risks such as exchange hacks, insolvency, and governmental restrictions. The best way to take full control over your Bitcoin is through self-custody. 💪

**Self-custody** refers to holding your own private keys, meaning no intermediary controls your Bitcoin. This form of ownership offers unmatched sovereignty over your assets. Unlike traditional financial systems, where your funds can be frozen or seized, Bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet is censorship-resistant. No government or third party can freeze, confiscate, or debase your Bitcoin, giving you complete control over your wealth. 🛡️

## Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets
The key difference between **custodial** and **non-custodial wallets** lies in who controls the private keys. With custodial wallets, such as those on centralized exchanges, the platform holds your private keys, which means you don't have full control over your Bitcoin. It's similar to how a bank manages your money—your access can be restricted or frozen at any time. 🏦

For example, even though it's legal to own Bitcoin in most countries, many banks may block transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges. So, while your funds are technically yours, you're still at the mercy of intermediaries. 🚫

By contrast, non-custodial wallets place the private keys in your hands, offering you true ownership and full control of your Bitcoin. Non-custodial wallets have become essential for users who want to avoid the risks associated with relying on exchanges or intermediaries. A clear lesson from past exchange hacks, like the Mt. Gox incident, is that trusting third parties with your Bitcoin can result in losses. Self-custody removes that risk. 🔐


## Private Keys and Mnemonic Phrases (Seed Phrases)
Understanding private keys and seed phrases (mnemonic phrases) are critical to securing your Bitcoin. When you set up a new non-custodial wallet, you're presented with a private key. To make storing and managing this key easier, the wallet generates a **mnemonic phrase**—a human-readable, 12-word phrase that acts as a backup to your private key. 📝

Think of your private key as the password to access and spend your Bitcoin, while the mnemonic phrase is a backup that lets you recover your wallet if something happens to your device. If you lose access to your private key or mnemonic phrase, you lose access to your Bitcoin forever. For example, there are many cases of early Bitcoin adopters losing their wallets because they didn't store their private keys properly, resulting in millions of dollars in lost assets. 💸
