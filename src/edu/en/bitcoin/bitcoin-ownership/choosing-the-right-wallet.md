# Choosing the Right Wallet

When it comes to choosing a non-custodial wallet, you need to balance **security**, **convenience**, and **practicality**. If maximum security is your priority, hardware wallets such as **Ledger** or **Trezor** provide offline storage, making them more secure against online threats. 🔒🖥️

However, there are a few factors to consider with hardware wallets:

- **Setup Complexity**: Hardware wallets can be complicated to set up and may not be beginner-friendly. 🧩
- **Security Breaches**: Some hardware wallet vendors have had data breaches, revealing users' personal information, making them vulnerable to targeted attacks. 🚨
- **Inconvenience for Daily Use**: Hardware wallets are not ideal for frequent transactions because they need to be plugged in and verified for every action. 🔌
- **Storage Risks**: You must keep your hardware wallet secure and store the private key backup separately(which kind of negates its advantages). 🏦

For frequent transactions, non-custodial mobile wallet apps, such as **Unstoppable Wallet**, offer a more user-friendly experience. Mobile wallets often include additional security features like biometric authentication, built-in exchanges, and even **duress modes**—a feature where you can unlock a decoy wallet under threat. 📱👆
Moreover, unlike hardware wallet devices mobile based wallet apps are easy to hide, both iOS and Android operating systems provide such capabilities. This combination of security and convenience makes mobile wallets more practical for everyday use. 🔐📲
