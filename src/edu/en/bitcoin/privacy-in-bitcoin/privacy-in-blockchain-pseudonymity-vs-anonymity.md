# Privacy in Blockchain: Pseudonymity vs. Anonymity

The Bitcoin blockchain operates on a **pseudonymous system**, meaning that while addresses are not directly tied to real-world identities, all transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. This creates privacy challenges, as certain public tools can potentially trace Bitcoin addresses back to individuals. 🔍

For example, if a user purchases Bitcoin through a centralized crypto exchange linked to their personal information (such as a bank account), their Bitcoin address could be traced back to them. Over time, with enough data, someone could link multiple transactions and Bitcoin addresses to form a profile. 🧑‍💻

While the Bitcoin blockchain offers pseudonymity, it is **not anonymous by default**. Users need to be aware that their activity on the blockchain is publicly available, and third parties can analyze this data to deanonymize them. 📊
