# SPV Wallets: A Simple User's Guide

SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) wallets are a user-friendly option for people who want to use Bitcoin on their smartphones or computers without sacrificing decentralization. 🚀

Among non-custodial wallets, only two wallet types can connect and interact with the Bitcoin blockchain without a middleman: full-node wallets and SPV wallets. These wallets connect directly to the Bitcoin blockchain without relying on a wallet provider or any centralized entity. As long as the device has internet access, the wallet app can send and receive transactions. This means that not only does the user gain complete ownership over their Bitcoin, but they also maintain independent and unconditional access to the Bitcoin network for transacting. 🌐

Think of an SPV wallet as a lightweight version of a full Bitcoin node. It connects directly to the Bitcoin blockchain without intermediaries but allows you to send and receive Bitcoin without downloading and storing the entire Bitcoin transaction history (which is vast and constantly growing). SPV-enabled mobile wallets strike a good balance between convenience and decentralization. ⚖️

## What to Know About SPV Wallets:
- They are **slower** when it comes to synchronizing your balance with the Bitcoin network compared to non-custodial wallets without SPV capabilities. However, SPV wallets often provide different synchronization modes, allowing users to switch between decentralized (direct blockchain access) and centralized (via a third-party server) synchronization. 🐢🏃‍♂️

- SPV-enabled wallets are **significantly better at preserving privacy**. Non-custodial wallets that provide instant synchronization times typically track user addresses to facilitate this speed. 🕵️‍♀️🔒
