# Bitcoin as a Cryptocurrency 💰

## BTC as the Native Unit
Bitcoin (BTC) is the main currency used on the Bitcoin network. It is the **first decentralized digital currency** and is recognized globally as a new form of money. All transactions within the network are settled in BTC, making it the primary unit of value. 🌍

**📊 Scarcity and Practical Supply**
Bitcoin's fixed supply is capped at **21 million coins**, making it scarce by design. However, the actual number of Bitcoins available is even smaller. Many Bitcoins have been lost due to forgotten passwords or misplaced wallets, reducing the number of coins that can ever be used. It's estimated that about 4 million Bitcoins are gone forever, and a large number of Bitcoins are held by long-term investors who rarely sell. 🔒

In practical terms, the number of Bitcoins actively traded on exchanges or distributed through mining rewards and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) is much smaller than the theoretical supply. This real-world scarcity makes Bitcoin even more valuable over time. 📈

**🔢 Divisibility and Satoshis**
Even though Bitcoin is scarce, it's highly divisible. Each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million units, known as **Satoshis**. This means you don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin to use it—small fractions can be used for everyday transactions, making Bitcoin accessible to anyone. 🔬
