# The Bitcoin Network Structure 🏗️

## Network Nodes
At the heart of the Bitcoin network are **nodes**. A node is any computer running the Bitcoin software, and its job is to help maintain the integrity of the network. Every node stores a complete copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, meaning it holds a record of every transaction ever made. Nodes communicate with each other to verify transactions and ensure that the network runs smoothly. When a transaction is made, it is broadcast to all nodes. These nodes validate the transaction by checking the user's balance and ensuring the rules of the network are followed. Once verified, the transaction is added to a pool of unconfirmed transactions, awaiting confirmation by miners. The fact that anyone can run a node ensures that Bitcoin remains decentralized—no single entity controls the network. 🔗📡

## Miners and Mining Nodes
**Mining nodes**, or miners, play a special role in the Bitcoin network. In addition to storing a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions like regular nodes, miners are responsible for grouping transactions into **blocks** and adding them to the blockchain. To do this, they must solve complex mathematical puzzles, which requires significant computational power. This process is known as **Proof of Work (PoW)**. When a miner successfully solves the puzzle, they create a new block and are rewarded with freshly minted Bitcoin, along with the transaction fees from the transactions included in that block. This process ensures that new Bitcoins are created in a decentralized manner and that transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. Mining not only adds new blocks to the chain but also keeps the network secure by making it difficult for any single entity to take control. 🧮💻
