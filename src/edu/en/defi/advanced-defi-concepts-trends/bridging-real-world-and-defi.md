# Bridging Real World and DeFi

**Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization**

While stablecoins represent the first wave of bringing real-world value into DeFi, tokenization is expanding to other assets. Gold-backed tokens offer a prime example â€“ each token represents one gram of physical gold stored in vaults.

This trend continues to extend to various assets:

- Precious metals
- Real estate
- Commodities
- Traditional financial instruments

**Oracles in DeFi**

Oracles solve a fundamental challenge in DeFi: accessing external data. Smart contracts can't naturally access information outside the blockchain, yet many DeFi applications require real-world data. Oracles provide this crucial link.

For example, some derivative token which pegged in price to a real world asset needs accurate gold prices to maintain its peg. Oracles provide this data through:

- Multiple data sources
- Decentralized verification
- Secure transmission of data to smart contracts
- Regular price updates
