# Institutional DeFi

As institutions enter DeFi, platforms looking to serve these clients are adapting to meet regulatory requirements. New services combine DeFi's efficiency with traditional finance's compliance:

- KYC verification for users
- Transaction monitoring
- Regulatory reporting

For instance, lending service Save launched a service named Arc aimed specifically at institutions. Arc is a permissioned liquidity pool specifically designed for institutions to maintain regulatory compliance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

These institutional adaptations show how DeFi is evolving beyond its original retail focus while maintaining its core benefits of efficiency and transparency.
