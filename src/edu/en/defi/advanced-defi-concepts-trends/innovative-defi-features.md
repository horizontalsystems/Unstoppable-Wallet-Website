# Innovative DeFi Features

**Flash Loans**

Flash loans represent a unique DeFi innovation impossible in traditional finance. They allow users to borrow any amount without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction block. If the loan isn't repaid, the entire transaction reverts as if it never happened.

Think of it like borrowing money to buy something and immediately reselling it for profit â€“ but everything happens instantaneously. For example, a user might:

1. Borrow 1 million USDT
2. Use it for arbitrage trading
3. Return the loan plus fees All in one atomic transaction.

**DeFi Aggregators**

DeFi aggregators leverage the composable nature of smart contracts to optimize user transactions. For instance, when trading tokens, 1inch DEX aggregator utilises its smart contracts to:

- Check prices across multiple DEXes
- Split the order for best execution
- Execute trades across different platforms
- Return the optimal result to the user

This interoperability between different DeFi protocols showcases how DeFi services can build upon each other to enhance user outcomes.
