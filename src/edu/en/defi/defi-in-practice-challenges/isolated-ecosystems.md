# Isolated Ecosystems

This multi-chain development, while fostering innovation, creates several practical challenges for users. The first challenge is similar to needing different bank accounts in different countries â€“ each blockchain typically requires its own wallet. While some users prefer specialized wallets like Phantom for Solana or MetaMask for Ethereum, universal wallets like Unstoppable are emerging to simplify this experience.

Transaction fees present another consideration. Just as you need local currency for expenses in different countries, each blockchain requires its native token for transactions. You'll need ETH for DeFi transactions on Ethereum, SOL for Solana operations, and AVAX for using Avalanche services.

Perhaps the most significant challenge is the scattered nature of assets and services across these platforms. Imagine having money in a bank that can't directly transfer to another bank in a different country. Similarly, if you have USDT on one blockchain (like TRON), you can't directly use it on another (like Ethereum) without first converting it through a service known as bridge or some centralized exchange.
