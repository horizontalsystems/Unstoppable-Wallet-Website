# The Multi-Chain Reality

As we've explored the various DeFi services like decentralized exchanges and lending platforms, you might wonder why there are so many different versions of seemingly similar services. The answer lies in how DeFi has evolved across multiple blockchain platforms, each creating its own vibrant ecosystem.

Think of these blockchain platforms as different cities, each with its own financial district. Ethereum, the oldest and largest, is like New York's Wall Street â€“ established, influential, but often expensive to operate in. Here you'll find the original versions of many popular services: Uniswap for trading, Aave for lending, and a wide variety of stablecoins like USDT and USDC.

Newer platforms like Solana have emerged as alternatives, similar to emerging financial centers. Solana, with its high-speed transactions and lower costs, hosts its own versions of these services, including Raydium for trading and Solend for lending. Similarly, Avalanche has developed its own ecosystem, with Trader Joe leading its trading services and platforms like Benqi providing lending options.
