# DeFi Security: Beyond Wallets

While securing your non-custodial wallet is essential, DeFi security requires a more comprehensive approach. The decentralized nature of these services introduces additional security considerations that users must understand and address.

### Smart Contract Risks

Smart contracts form the foundation of DeFi services, but they can contain vulnerabilities that put user funds at risk. These vulnerabilities may be intentional or unintentional, and when exploited, they can result in significant financial losses.

For example, a DEX smart contract vulnerability could allow attackers to drain the entire liquidity pool, leaving liquidity providers with nothing. This isn't just theoretical â€“ multiple DeFi services have suffered such attacks, resulting in millions of dollars in losses.

To minimize smart contract risks:

- Use well-established, community-tested DeFi services
- Look for services that have undergone security audits
- Start with small amounts when trying new services
- Use a separate wallet when trying a new service

### Phishing Threats

Phishing attacks in DeFi are particularly dangerous because transactions are irreversible. Attackers create convincing copies of legitimate DeFi websites, attempting to trick users into approving malicious transactions that steal their funds.

Essential phishing prevention practices:

- Access DeFi services directly through official websites
- Avoid clicking links from Discord, Telegram, or email
- Double-check website URLs carefully
- Use a separate wallet specifically for DeFi activities

There were a lot of cases where Twitter accounts of popular DeFi services were hacked and promoted links meant to steal users funds.

### Best Practices for DeFi Security

Create a dedicated DeFi wallet with limited funds rather than using your main storage wallet. This separation serves two purposes:

1. Limits potential losses if you make a mistake
2. Keeps your main holdings secure even if you interact with a compromised service

Never "experiment" with DeFi using a wallet containing substantial assets unless you're absolutely certain about the transaction's security and legitimacy.
