# Privacy in DeFi

DeFi inherently offers limited privacy because most blockchain platforms it operates on, like Ethereum and Solana, are completely public. Every transaction you make is visible to anyone who looks up your wallet address, including:

- Token balances
- Trading history
- Lending activities
- Smart contract interactions

### Privacy Enhancement Strategies

While complete privacy is difficult to achieve in DeFi, you can take steps to protect your financial privacy. The most practical approach is using separate wallets for different purposes:

- Main wallet for asset storage
- DeFi wallet for trading and lending
- Additional wallets for specific high-value activities

This separation prevents observers from connecting all your financial activities to a single address. However, remember that transactions between your wallets are still traceable on the blockchain.
