# Traditional Finance vs. DeFi

The traditional financial system operates through centralized intermediaries, with banks and financial institutions serving as gatekeepers to financial services. These institutions maintain strict control over who can access services, requiring extensive documentation and often imposing restrictions based on geography or wealth.

Common restrictions in traditional finance include:

- Extensive documentation requirements for account opening
- Minimum balance requirements and service fees
- Geographic limitations on service availability
- Restricted access to premium financial products

In contrast, DeFi reimagines this system by eliminating intermediaries through blockchain technology. By leveraging automated processes and open access protocols, DeFi creates a globally available financial system that anyone can access. This fundamental shift removes traditional barriers while maintaining security and reliability through technological innovation rather than institutional oversight.
