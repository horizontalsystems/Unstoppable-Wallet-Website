# Stablecoins: The Foundation of DeFi

Stablecoins form the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, providing a stable medium of exchange and reliable unit of account. These digital assets maintain a steady value, typically pegged to the US dollar, enabling consistent pricing and reduced volatility in DeFi transactions.

### Centralized Stablecoins: The Case of USDT

Tether (USDT) exemplifies the centralized stablecoin approach. The system operates through smart contracts controlled by Tether Limited, which manages the issuance and redemption of USDT. When users purchase USDT, Tether Limited maintains equivalent traditional currency reserves to support the 1:1 USD peg.

Key characteristics of USDT include:

- Central management by Tether Limited
- Traditional currency backing
- Wide acceptance across DeFi platforms
- Administrative controls including balance freezing capabilities

### Decentralized Stablecoins: DAI and Beyond

DAI represents a truly decentralized alternative to centralized stablecoins. Its decentralized nature ensures that no central authority can freeze or confiscate user funds. Instead, DAI maintains its value through smart contracts and cryptocurrency collateral.

Users can acquire DAI in two ways:

- Purchase directly from cryptocurrency exchanges
- Generate DAI through the MakerDAO protocol by following these steps:
    1. Connect your wallet to MakerDAO
    2. Deposit cryptocurrency collateral
    3. Generate DAI based on collateral value
    4. Maintain a healthy collateral ratio to avoid liquidation
