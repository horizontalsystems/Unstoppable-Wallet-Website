# Getting Started with DeFi

Before diving into DeFi services, you need two fundamental components: a non-custodial wallet and some native cryptocurrency of your chosen blockchain.

Your choice of wallet will largely determine which DeFi services you can access. Non-custodial wallets give you complete control over your funds and the ability to interact with DeFi protocols.

Popular wallet options include:

- Mobile wallets: Unstoppable offers comprehensive support for multiple blockchains and DeFi platforms
- Browser wallets: MetaMask dominates Ethereum and compatible chains
- Specialized wallets: Phantom serves as the primary wallet for Solana DeFi users

For most users, a versatile wallet like Unstoppable will cover the majority of DeFi use cases, but your choice should align with your intended blockchain ecosystem.

Each blockchain requires its native cryptocurrency to pay for DeFi transactions. You'll need ETH for Ethereum transactions, SOL for Solana, or AVAX for Avalanche. Every DeFi interaction requires transaction fees, so maintaining adequate native currency is essential for continuous operation.
