## DeFi Safety

Following these essential safety practices helps protect your assets:

- Start with small amounts to learn platform mechanics
- Maintain sufficient funds for multiple transactions
- Verify all addresses and permissions carefully
- Research platform-specific requirements thoroughly
- Monitor your positions regularly

It's crucial to understand that this is only a basic list of safety measures and by no means complete. DeFi security requires proper self-education to master the subject and stay secure. The complexity of DeFi security goes well beyond simply using services like DEXes or lending platforms â€“ it encompasses understanding smart contract risks, platform-specific vulnerabilities, market manipulation risks, and numerous other security considerations. Users should invest time in continuous learning about DeFi security practices to protect their assets effectively.
