# Common DeFi Use Cases

### Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

DEXs enable permissionless cryptocurrency trading without intermediaries. Each blockchain ecosystem has its own popular DEX platforms:

- Ethereum: Uniswap leads as the primary DEX
- Solana: Raydium and Orca dominate the ecosystem
- Avalanche: Trader Joe serves as the main trading platform
- Binance Smart Chain: PancakeSwap handles most trading volume

Anyone can trade on these DEXs by connecting their wallet, selecting tokens, and confirming transactions. First-time users must approve token access, but subsequent trades become more straightforward.

DEXs rely on liquidity providers who supply trading pairs and earn rewards from trading fees. To become a liquidity provider, users must:

- Understand impermanent loss risks
- Deposit equal values of both tokens in a trading pair
- Monitor their positions and market conditions

The primary advantage of DEXs is their permissionless nature – anyone can trade without restrictions based on geography, age, or status. No registration or identification is required; you simply need a wallet and tokens to trade.

However, DEXs face certain limitations. Liquidity can be restricted for some trading pairs, potentially affecting trade execution and prices. Additionally, DEXs are typically limited to tokens within their blockchain ecosystem. For example, Uniswap on Ethereum cannot directly trade Bitcoin (BTC), though cross-chain bridge services are emerging to address this limitation.

### Lending and Borrowing

DeFi lending platforms have revolutionized borrowing and lending. Each blockchain ecosystem features its own leading platforms:

- Ethereum: Aave and Compound lead the lending space
- Solana: Solend provides lending services
- Avalanche: Aave has expanded here, alongside native platforms like Benqi
- Binance Smart Chain: Venus Protocol offers lending functionality

The primary use case for borrowing is obtaining liquidity without selling your cryptocurrency assets. For example, if you hold ETH but need cash flow, you can borrow against your ETH as collateral rather than selling it, maintaining your long-term investment position.

From the lending perspective, these platforms offer an opportunity to earn interest on cryptocurrency assets, similar to traditional bank deposits but typically with higher yields. Lenders provide liquidity to the platform and earn interest from borrowers' payments.

Important considerations for lending and borrowing:

- Maintain healthy collateral ratios
- Monitor positions and interest rates regularly
- Understand liquidation mechanisms
- Plan exit strategies carefully

The main benefit of DeFi lending platforms is their open accessibility. Anyone can lend or borrow without traditional banking requirements or credit checks. Interest rates are typically more attractive than traditional banking, and the process is entirely automated through smart contracts.

However, these platforms have notable limitations. Most significantly, borrowing typically requires over-collateralization – you must deposit collateral worth more than your borrowed amount, often 150% or higher. This makes these platforms less suitable for those seeking traditional loans without existing crypto assets. Additionally, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency can lead to sudden liquidations if collateral values drop significantly.
