# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

DAOs enable community-driven decision-making through the use of smart contracts and governance tokens. These organizations operate transparently, with rules embedded in code, ensuring decentralized and democratic control.

### **Typical DAO Functions**:

- Voting on protocol changes and updates
- Managing community treasury funds
- Proposing new features or improvements
- Participating in profit-sharing mechanisms

### **DAOs and Composability**:

DAOs often leverage composable smart contracts to enhance their functionality:

- Treasury management: DAOs can integrate with lending protocols like Compound to earn interest on idle funds.
- Governance tooling: DAOs can utilize modular voting systems that interact with on-chain and off-chain data sources for decision-making.
- Cross-DAO collaboration: DAOs can partner by pooling resources or executing joint strategies via interoperable smart contracts, creating a more robust DeFi ecosystem.
