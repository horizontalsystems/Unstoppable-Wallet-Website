# Transaction Complexity

DeFi transactions are fundamentally different from simple cryptocurrency transfers. When you send cryptocurrency from one address to another, it's a straightforward operation. However, DeFi transactions often involve multiple steps and complex smart contract interactions, making them more resource-intensive and, consequently, more expensive.

For example, when you swap tokens on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, the transaction includes calculating exchange rates, managing liquidity pools, and executing the swap. Each of these steps requires computational resources on the blockchain, leading to higher transaction fees compared to simple token transfers.

This complexity has different cost implications across various blockchains:

- On Ethereum: A simple ETH transfer might cost $1-5, while a DeFi interaction like token swapping could easily cost $20-100 or more, depending on network conditions.
- On Solana: Both regular transfers and DeFi interactions typically cost considerably less than $1, making it more accessible for frequent trading and experimentation.
