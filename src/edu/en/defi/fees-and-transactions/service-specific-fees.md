# Service-Specific Fees

Beyond blockchain transaction fees, DeFi services typically charge their own fees for the services they provide. These protocol fees are distinct from network transaction fees and are used to compensate liquidity providers, maintain protocol development, or simply as revenue for the DAO behind the given service.

Common examples include:

- Uniswap charges 0.3% per trade, distributed to liquidity providers
- Aave's lending fees vary based on market conditions and borrowing demand

Understanding these different fee layers is crucial for effective DeFi participation. Users need to consider both the blockchain transaction fees and the protocol-specific fees when planning their DeFi activities. This is particularly important for smaller transactions, where fees can potentially outweigh the intended benefits of the transaction itself.
