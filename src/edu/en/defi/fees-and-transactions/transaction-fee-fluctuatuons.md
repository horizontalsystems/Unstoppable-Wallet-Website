# Transaction Fee Fluctuations

Just like regular wallet to wallet transfers, DeFi transaction fees fluctuate based on network activity. During periods of high activity, such as market volatility when a lot of people trying to buy or sell something, network congestion can drive fees significantly higher.

Conversely, during quieter periods, the same transactions might cost substantially less. Therefore, some users may want to choose to execute transactions during off-peak hours, like weekends or early mornings, to minimize costs.
