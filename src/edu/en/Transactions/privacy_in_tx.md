# PRIVACY IN TRANSACTIONS


While blockchain technology offers transparency and security, it’s essential to recognize the limitations of privacy when using cryptocurrencies and tokens.


### General Privacy Considerations

Most blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, store transaction data openly, making it accessible to anyone.

This means that details such as transaction times, amounts, and sender/receiver addresses are visible to the public. Although these addresses are pseudonymous and not directly linked to real-world identities, they can sometimes be traced back, compromising privacy.

In contrast, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash are designed to conceal transaction details, ensuring that no information is publicly disclosed. However, for most popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, transparency is inherent.

Given this, neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum should be relied upon for transactions where high levels of privacy are required.


### Bitcoin Privacy

Bitcoin wallets are designed to allow users to generate numerous addresses for receiving payments. Each address can be used multiple times or only once—it’s entirely up to the user. To enhance privacy, users are encouraged to use a new address for each transaction.

A well-designed cryptocurrency wallet app that supports Bitcoin will automatically generate a new receiving address after each payment to discourage the reuse of addresses.

If a user consistently uses the same address, anyone with access to one of their transactions could trace other incoming and outgoing transactions, revealing transaction history, dates, amounts, and possibly the user’s total balance.

Thus, to maintain privacy, it’s important to use a wallet that handles address generation automatically, minimizing the need for manual intervention.


### Ethereum Privacy

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum wallets maintain a single address for receiving Ether payments within a wallet. The Ethereum blockchain is fully transparent, allowing anyone to view all transactions associated with an address. Although the address itself isn’t linked to a real-world identity, this transparency can still pose privacy risks.

When sending or receiving Ethereum, be aware that the other party can view your balance, see any Ethereum-based tokens (like USDT), and track your transaction history—all from knowing your address.

To mitigate these risks, it’s advisable to use separate wallets for different purposes. For example, you could use one wallet for everyday transactions and another for asset accumulation. This separation ensures that your main holdings remain private, even if your transaction wallet is exposed.


### Privacy in Multicoin Wallets

While the privacy characteristics of cryptocurrencies depend on the underlying properties of their respective blockchains, wallet providers play an important role in how well those privacy features are implemented.

Finally, it’s important to note that the privacy of one cryptocurrency within a multicoin wallet does not affect the privacy of another. For example, revealing your Ethereum address does not compromise your Bitcoin activity, even if both are managed within the same wallet.
