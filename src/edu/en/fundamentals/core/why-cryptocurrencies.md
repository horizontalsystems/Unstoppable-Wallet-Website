# Why Cryptocurrencies?

To understand cryptocurrencies in a broad sense, we need to first understand Bitcoin and explore its foundational principles. Why did Bitcoin grow, and why are more and more people getting attracted to it?

## 1)  Practical Advantages of Owning Bitcoin

- **🌍 Easily Move Capital Globally**
The ability to transfer capital across borders in a discreet manner.

- **📍 Access Capital Anywhere**
The ability to access capital from any location discreetly.

- **🤝 Transact Freely**
The ability to transact with anyone without relying on intermediaries like banks or a money transmitter service.

- **💰 Preserve & Grow Capital**
The ability to save, preserve capital, and escape inflation. In fact, the rising popularity of Bitcoin has made it an effective instrument for multiplying capital by investing in the asset long-term.

## 2)  Characteristics of Bitcoin
   In a broader sense, Bitcoin is a type of money that has the following characteristics:

- **🔗 Decentralized Control**
Is not controlled by any single entity.

- **📉 Fixed Supply**
Cannot be printed or inflated by any entity.

- **🛡️ Resilient**
Cannot be censored or shut down.

The main reason that attracted some of its strongest proponents (long before it became hugely popular) lies in the idea of democratic access to an alternative financial system where there are no borders or gatekeepers.

Unlike the legacy financial system, which is highly regulated, anyone can freely access and participate in the Bitcoin network on equal terms. 🔗
