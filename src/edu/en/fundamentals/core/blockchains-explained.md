# Blockchains Explained

Let’s explore how Bitcoin and other top-tier cryptocurrencies work. What makes them special, and how are they different from traditional money in your bank account?

Bitcoin and top-tier cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are powered by blockchain technology. This technology enables millions of independent entities (phones, computers, servers, etc.) to transact securely in real time without relying on a central authority.

Every blockchain operates through a publicly open software program (a piece of code) that allows users to send transactions to one another and tracks their balances.

#### What Makes Blockchain Special?
Blockchain technology is unique due to the following characteristics:

- 📡 **Distributed:**
Instead of being stored in a single centralized location, the blockchain allows the transaction history to be held in thousands of locations simultaneously. Every participant keeps a copy, which is updated in near real-time.

- 🔗 **Peer-to-Peer:**
Any participant can add a new transaction to the global transaction history by communicating with any entity on the network. This transaction is then propagated to all other entities on that network. The absence of a “single point of access” ensures 24/7 availability and unconditional access to participation.

- 🔍 **Transparent:**
Blockchains are generally transparent, meaning the entire transaction history is public and accessible for anyone to scrutinize. While transactions are public, the identities of the entities involved are masked: third parties can see what’s happening but cannot identify who exactly was involved.

- 🔒 **Immutable:**
Once a transaction has taken place, it cannot be reversed. This ensures that no entity can alter the transaction history.

- ⚖️ **Democratic:**
All network participants are equal and abide by the same set of rules. If one entity tries to act outside the agreed-upon rules, their actions will be disregarded by other participants.

For instance, a blockchain like Bitcoin is essentially a large network of devices (computers, miners, etc.) running open-source Bitcoin software. These devices continuously communicate with each other and maintain a record of Bitcoin transactions conducted between network participants (i.e., wallets).

In this way, Bitcoin aims to provide a financial platform for secure value exchange without relying on gatekeepers or intermediaries like banks.
