# Cryptocurrency & Ownership

In the world of cryptocurrency, **true ownership** stands out as one of its most significant benefits. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology empower individuals with **self-custody**, allowing them to keep their wealth **independent**, **private**, and **easily transportable**. This was never possible before! 🚀

💵 **Traditional fiat money**, whether in your bank account or held as cash, can be **confiscated**, **sanctioned**, **or stolen**. It’s not uncommon for banks or governments to limit access to capital, restrict transactions, or even confiscate assets. In contrast, cryptocurrency enables capital ownership that is **discrete** and **resistant to censorship**.

Keeping wealth in **cash or hard assets** such as gold also comes with **security risks** and the challenge of transportation. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are **easy to conceal**, **convenient to transport**, and can be used almost anywhere in the world. 🌍

Moreover, over the years, **Bitcoin** has proven to be an ideal **hedge against inflation**, often outperforming all other asset classes. While fiat savers are losing purchasing power, **Bitcoin holders (HODLers)** are gaining. 📈

Contrary to common belief, mastering **crypto self-custody** is not a daunting task; it’s about understanding the fundamentals that can make you virtually **unstoppable**. 💪
