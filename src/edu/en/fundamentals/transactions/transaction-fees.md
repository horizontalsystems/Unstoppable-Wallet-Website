# TRANSACTION FEES

While blockchain technology itself is free to use, every transaction made on a blockchain network requires a small fee. In both the Ethereum and Bitcoin networks, these transaction fees are paid by the sender directly to the blockchain. This applies to **every transaction** conducted using a non-custodial wallet. 🔗

## 💰 Paying Transaction Fees
Transaction fees must be paid in the **native cryptocurrency** of the blockchain being used. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, fees are paid in ETH, while on the Bitcoin blockchain, fees are paid in BTC.

If you are sending USDT (Tether) on the Ethereum network, you'll need ETH to cover the transaction fee. On the other hand, if you're sending USDT on the Tron blockchain, the fee would be paid in TRX (Tron). 💱

It's not uncommon for newcomers to be confused when asked to deposit some ETH, TRX, or another cryptocurrency to send USDT via a non-custodial wallet. 🤔

## 🎯 Purpose of Transaction Fees
Transaction fees serve several **crucial purposes**. One of the primary reasons for these fees is that blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum can process only a limited number of transactions per day. To prioritize transactions, users can offer higher fees, ensuring their transfers are processed more quickly. This creates an open market where those needing faster confirmations can pay for priority. ⚡

Additionally, fees act as a deterrent against spam attacks. Without fees, it would be easy for bad actors to flood the blockchain with spam transactions, congesting the network and slowing down legitimate transfers. 🛡️

## 🤑 Who Receives the Fees?
You don't need to dive deep into the technical details, but it's useful to know that thousands of nodes (or miners in the Bitcoin network) power the blockchain. When you send a transaction, it is broadcasted to these nodes within seconds. The node that first adds your transaction to the blockchain earns the transaction fee as a reward. 🏆

Each time you make a transaction, a different node processes it and collects the fee. Consider this as a service charge for using the network. 🔧

##  📊 Fees Are Dynamic
Transaction fees are **not fixed**; they fluctuate based on the current state of the blockchain. When the network is congested or experiencing high demand, fees can increase significantly, sometimes reaching several dollars per transaction. Conversely, when the network is less busy, fees can drop to just a fraction of a cent. 📈📉

If your transaction fee is set well below the network's average, your transaction may remain pending for hours or even days. In extreme cases, it may be rejected entirely, as if it were never sent. On the other hand, paying a fee above the average ensures that your transaction is processed quickly, often within seconds or minutes, depending on the blockchain's conditions. ⏳

Some wallet apps, including Unstoppable, recommend the optimal transaction fee based on current network conditions, helping you find the right balance between cost and speed. ⚖️

When sending large sums or time-sensitive payments, it's wise to set a transaction fee above the average to ensure your transfer reaches its destination without delay. 🚀

The value being transferred in transaction **doesn't impact its fee**. In other words, a transaction transferring $1mill. worth of BTC can cost less than a transaction sending 10$ worth of BTC. 💡
