# Hardware Wallets
Newcomers to cryptocurrency are often advised to use hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger. While these wallets are secure in theory, they are **far from ideal** in practice.

There are several important considerations and risks associated with hardware wallets that are often overlooked. Let's explore why hardware non-custodial wallets may not be as perfect as they seem. 🕵️‍♀️

## 📚 Hardware Wallets in Theory
All non-custodial wallets—whether desktop apps, mobile apps, or hardware devices—share one crucial feature: they generate and store **private keys**, which are essential for owning and managing cryptocurrency.

In theory, hardware wallets are considered superior for key safety because it's generally more challenging to find vulnerabilities in a device built for a specific purpose by a small, focused team than in a general-purpose operating system like Windows, Android, or iOS. 🛡️

## 🛠️ Hardware Wallets in Practice
In reality, there are several practical issues that diminish the advantages of hardware wallets:
1) 🛒 Purchase and Setup
The process of buying and setting up a hardware wallet is still **complicated and not very user-friendly**, especially for those new to crypto. Security and privacy considerations—such as where to buy, which delivery address to use, and how to set up and back up the wallet—can be daunting. Many people mistakenly buy devices from unauthorized resellers or receive tampered devices, resulting in the loss of funds once they deposit their cryptocurrency. 😰
2) 💦 Vendor Data Leaks
There have been several cases where hardware wallet vendors had their client databases breached, exposing user names, emails, and physical addresses. This poses serious risks, particularly for high-net-worth individuals or those living in high-crime areas. 🚨
3) 🎣 Phishing Attacks
Once user data is exposed, those users become prime targets for phishing attacks. Hackers may send emails posing as the wallet vendor, often announcing updates or other notifications. Users should be **extremely cautious** with such emails and avoid updating unless absolutely necessary. 🚫
4) 🔄Ongoing Usage
Hardware wallets are not well-suited for frequent use. If you store large amounts of cryptocurrency on a hardware wallet, carrying the device with you can pose a greater security risk than using a non-custodial mobile wallet, which is more convenient for regular transactions. 📱
5) 🏦Safe Storage of the Device
Users must keep the hardware wallet hidden and safe from damage, while also securely storing backups of the private keys separately. This can be more challenging than it seems and may even defeat the purpose of using a hardware wallet. 🤦‍♂️
6) 👥Team Behind the Wallet
The qualifications of the team behind the hardware wallet are crucial. Established vendors like Trezor and Ledger have experienced teams, but newer or lesser-known brands may not offer the same level of security or reliability. 🏢
7) 🛠️Lack of Features
Hardware wallets often lack the additional features that are available in mobile wallets. The versatility of mobile operating systems allows for the integration of enhanced security features and tools that make ongoing usage and safe storage more manageable. For example, mobile wallets can offer biometric security, built-in exchanges, or multi-asset management, which aren't available on most hardware devices. 📲
8) 👀Visibility and Discreetness
Hardware wallets are easily recognizable as cryptocurrency storage devices, which can attract unwanted attention and pose security risks, especially if carried around. 🕵️‍♂️
#### 🎓Conclusion
While hardware wallets are often recommended for their security, they are **not without significant drawbacks**. For many users, especially those who are less technically experienced, the complexities and risks associated with hardware wallets may outweigh their theoretical benefits. ⚖️
