# Must-haves For Non-Custodial Wallet

By now, you should have a solid understanding of self-custody and the roles non-custodial wallet apps play. The purpose of non-custodial wallet apps is to make the emerging concept of cryptocurrency self-custody **easy and accessible** for everyone. 🌟

While all non-custodial wallets are designed to securely store private keys, not all wallets are created equal. Building a robust non-custodial wallet is an **expensive and complex** engineering task. Users expect non-custodial wallet apps to be just as easy to use as the traditional financial apps they're accustomed to. 🛠️

A well-engineered wallet is expected to strike a balance between security and ease of use. However, there are several factors to consider when evaluating which wallet to use. Let's explore some **essential features** that a good non-custodial crypto wallet app should offer:

1) **🔐 Secure Enclave**
A secure enclave is a protected area in the wallet's hardware or software that provides an extra layer of security for handling private keys. Hardware wallets excel at this, but mobile wallet apps must leverage special-purpose mechanisms provided by Apple's iOS and Google's Android OS. This feature ensures that private keys are secure and inaccessible to malicious programs or apps that may infect a smartphone hosting the wallet app.
2) **🔑 Wallet Unlock Code**
A well-engineered wallet app should have a properly implemented app unlock code mechanism for accessing the wallet app. This unlock code is designed to keep crypto assets secure even if someone gains physical access to the smartphone but doesn't know the wallet app's unlock code.
3) **👁️ Open Source** 
Ideally, the wallet's source code should be open for public scrutiny, allowing the community to verify its security and trustworthiness. Open-source code ensures that the app works as advertised and adheres to all essential security protocols for private key generation and management. Without this transparency, there's no way to truly verify that the wallet app functions as claimed. Reputable websites such as two below list open-source crypto wallets:
- https://bitcoin.org
- https://walletscrutiny.com
4) **🔄 Cross-Wallet Interoperability**
The wallet should follow industry standards, ensuring compatibility and ease of use across different wallets. This ensures that it's possible to migrate wallets created in one app to another wallet app and vice versa.
5) **🌐 Multi-Coin Support**
The wallet app should support multiple cryptocurrencies within a single wallet, rather than requiring separate wallets for each cryptocurrency.
6) **📚 Multi-Wallet Capability**
The ability to create and manage an unlimited number of multi-coin wallets within a single wallet app.
7) **💾 Fail-Safe Backup Procedure**
A good wallet must ensure that users properly back up private keys (mnemonic phrases). Most wallets recommend offline backups and encourage users to write down the mnemonic phrase for each wallet on paper. However, this method may not be convenient or safe for the majority of mainstream users. A more user-friendly and fail-safe approach is to provide an additional option for encrypted backup to the cloud (e.g., Apple's iCloud or Google Drive).
8) **🚨 Duress Mode**
As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and more people carry it around, it's increasingly important to consider scenarios where users are forced to open their wallet apps by malicious actors. A good wallet app should account for this and implement features that allow users to hide certain wallets when under duress.
9) **🤳 Ease of Use**
Many wallet apps are complicated to use and not accessible to the mainstream audience. Therefore, when choosing a wallet app, opt for one that you find intuitive. The more complex the wallet is to use, the higher the chance of making a mistake.
