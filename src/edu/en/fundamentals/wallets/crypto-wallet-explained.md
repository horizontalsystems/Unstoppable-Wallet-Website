# CRYPTO WALLETS EXPLAINED 💼🔑

In practice, when you self-custody cryptocurrency, you essentially become the owner of a unique "**private key**," which grants you control over the cryptocurrency in a particular wallet. This key is not controlled by any entity other than yourself. However, anyone with access to that key can potentially spend the crypto assets it controls. 🔐

Cryptocurrency wallet apps are tools designed to store and manage these private keys. These apps generate and securely store private keys, effectively making you **your own bank**. 🏦 With that private key, crypto wallet apps such as Unstoppable make owning, receiving, and spending cryptocurrency much more manageable. These apps are referred to as **non-custodial wallet apps**. 📱

#### Crypto Wallets vs Crypto Wallet Apps 🆚

While these terms are often used interchangeably in the non-custodial crypto world, it's important to understand the distinction between them:

- Crypto Wallet: Typically refers to a "digital" wallet that can store various cryptocurrencies and tokens. Each crypto wallet is controlled by a single private key. 💰
- Crypto Wallet App: A piece of software, usually in the form of a mobile app or hardware device, that can generate and manage an unlimited number of crypto wallets. 📲

#### Custodial vs Non-custodial 🔒🆚🔓

Not all wallet apps are non-custodial. There are also so-called "custodial" wallet apps that don't grant you control. When using these wallets, you don't genuinely own any crypto but instead rely on a third party to store, receive, and send cryptocurrency. 👥

The entities behind custodial wallets can restrict your access to funds at any time. It's not uncommon for custodial wallet providers to be hacked or simply disappear with users' funds. 😨

It's important to note that custodial wallet providers are **not regulated financial entities** like banks, which introduces a significant risk when using them. ⚠️

How do you identify a non-custodial wallet app? A non-custodial wallet app should provide you with a private key for every wallet it creates. This key is typically presented in the form of 12 (sometimes 18 or 24) English words, commonly known as a **mnemonic phrase**. Additionally, the wallet app should strongly encourage you to back up these words to ensure you can restore access to your wallet in case the app malfunctions or you lose your device. 📝

#### Types of Non-Custodial Wallet Apps 🗂️

Non-custodial wallets come in various types. While all non-custodial wallets are designed for the secure storage of private keys, not all wallets are created equal. Understanding the types of non-custodial wallets is crucial for making informed choices about securing your cryptocurrency.

- **Hardware Wallets:** 💾

While these are secure, they can be complex to use and are not suitable for daily transactions. They also have limited features, can be difficult to use, and are unfortunately easily identifiable as crypto storage devices.

- **Mobile Wallets:** 📱

These offer a good balance between convenience, privacy, and security. While they may be less secure than hardware wallets, they are generally much easier to use and easier to conceal.

- **Desktop Wallets:** 💻

These are less secure compared to hardware or mobile wallets. Typically, it's not recommended to keep large sums on a wallet that resides on your all-purpose desktop computer or laptop.

- **Browser Wallets:** 🌐

These are considered the **least secure** due to a wide array of potential security breaches.
