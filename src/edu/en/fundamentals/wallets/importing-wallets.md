# Importing Wallets
Migrating or importing a wallet from one non-custodial wallet app to another is a **straightforward process**, provided the apps are standards-compliant. In essence, any wallet created in a non-custodial wallet app should be universally compatible with other similar apps. 🔀

This compatibility allows users to seamlessly switch between wallet apps without losing access to their funds. Remarkably, the same wallet can even be active on multiple apps simultaneously. 🔗

To restore or migrate a wallet, users only need the wallet's **mnemonic phrase**, often referred to as a seed phrase. If a passphrase was added during the wallet's creation, that too will be required. 🔑 Using these, the wallet app can regenerate the deposit addresses for all supported cryptocurrencies, even if no transactions have been made on some addresses. Once the addresses are recognized, the app will scan the blockchain to identify and display the wallet's balances. 🔍💰

However, it's important to note that if you are migrating a wallet containing multiple cryptocurrencies and tokens, only those supported by the destination wallet app will be accessible. For instance, if you're migrating a wallet holding both Ethereum and Bitcoin to an Ethereum-only wallet app, only the Ethereum balance will be available. ⚠️

## Bitcoin-Specific Considerations 🅱️
When migrating a wallet that holds Bitcoin (or Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin), you must ensure that the **correct address type** for the selected coin is specified. Many older wallets may use legacy address formats, while newer ones adopt updated formats. Certain wallet apps, like Unstoppable Wallet, support all address formats, simplifying the migration process. 🏛️➡️🆕
