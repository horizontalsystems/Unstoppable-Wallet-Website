# Why is my transaction "pending"?

Incoming transactions show up in your account almost instantly (within a few seconds) but will show as 'Pending' until there have been enough network confirmations. The number of confirmations needed is based on the digital currency.

Once a transaction is verified, it will show Complete in green. This lets you know that the transaction cannot be reversed and that the funds can be withdrawn.

Occasionally, transactions are not accepted by the rest of the network and therefore are never considered to be 'confirmed'.

**Common causes of unconfirmed transactions**

- Sending a very small amount with insufficient fees. All bitcoin transactions require a miner fee to be confirmed by the bitcoin network. When sending bitcoin, you will be prompted to add a miner fee to make sure the transaction gets confirmed. If an insufficient fee is included, your transaction may never confirm.
- The network is experiencing high volume. Sometimes there is a high volume of digital currency being sent globally, and there are more transactions than there is space available in each new block to include the transaction.
