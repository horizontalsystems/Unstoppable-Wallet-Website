# What are BEP20 tokens?

The BEP20 is Binance Smart Chain's version of Ethereum's ERC20 token standard. Those who are not familiar with the concept may get familiar with it in the Ethereum section.

It should be also noted that someone's address to receive BNB on Binance Smart Chain or some BEP20 tokens would always be the same.
