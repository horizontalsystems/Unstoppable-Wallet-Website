# How using TOR and VPN enhances privacy?

Features such as TOR, VPN(coming soon) in Unstoppable primarily help with breaking a link between a user's internet activity and a physical identity on a level of the internet provider.

Without such masking features users' activity like sites visited are clearly visible to the internet service provider.

If we are to assume that someone's internet activity is being tracked then without such features users may unintentionally expose their cryptocurrency addresses and even token balances simply by visiting some block explorer website and attempt to lookup activity on the address. Typically, people look up their own addresses.

People leaving in authoritarian environments may find such privacy enhancing capabilities useful.
