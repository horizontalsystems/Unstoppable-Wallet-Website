# What is Binance Smart Chain?

BSC is a clone of the Ethereum blockchain with some differences. While most things are similar in practice, it's a different blockchain with its own cryptocurrency token known as Binance Token (symbol BNB) and ecosystem.

BSC rose to popularity as a result of high usage and congestion on Ethereum blockchain which resulted in transactions becoming expensive.

BSC allows for much cheaper transactions as a result of having a fixed number of privileged validator nodes that process transactions on the blockchain. While this makes the blockchain network centralized and less secure it also makes it significantly faster.

Things to keep in mind when interacting with BSC ecosystem:
- a standalone blockchain with centralized architecture
- has its own cryptocurrency token and ecosystem
- allows for fast and cheap transactions
- less secure than Ethereum blockchain

BSC managed to attract a lot of projects over a short period of time and is one of the few blockchains that has a thriving ecosystem of smart-contract powered services which in many cases are clones of Ethereum-based projects.
