# When an Ethereum transaction considered final and irreversible?

While an Ethereum transaction is considered completed/confirmed when it has been included in the blockchain it's not considered final (irreversible) until a few more blocks have been added to the blockchain after it.

Without going too technical it's sufficient to know that in order for a transaction to be considered final and permanent (irreversible) it's recommended to wait 11 more blocks (about 3 min) after the block holding the original transaction was added to the blockchain.
