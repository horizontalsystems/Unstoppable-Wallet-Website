# Are my Bitcoin transactions and balance private?

While all Bitcoin transactions are visible on the blockchain, it's not always easy to link different transactions to the same entity.

As Bitcoin enables usage of unique addresses for each incoming payment, it provides a significantly higher layer of privacy than Ethereum. That's why Unstoppable wallet automatically changes the receive address after each received payment. Such a usage approach makes it significantly harder for anyone monitoring the blockchain to identify the user's balance and link all past transactions.

Just like for Ethereum, good privacy practice when it comes to Bitcoin is to use multiple wallets with clearly defined use cases:

- a rarely-used wallet for long storage that never transacts with entities that collect data.
- a wallet for transacting with exchanges etc
- a wallet for transacting with people

Apart from using a unique address for each incoming payment, wallets like Unstoppable are able to provide some further advanced privacy enhancing features which has to do with how transactions are structured.
