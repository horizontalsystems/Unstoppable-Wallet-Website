# What happens if unstoppable app goes down?

For the most part, an Unstoppable wallet app doesn't depend on any centrally managed servers that may result in the wallet app being unable to function that it should. The app should continue to function for as long as there is internet.

The only exception is the ability to transact (send and receive transactions) on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The communication with these blockchain is dependent on respective RPC providers for these blockchains. Currently, fully decentralized communication with these blockchains on mobile devices is problematic and therefore not implemented yet. In the near future, Unstoppable plans to provide users with the ability to use their own RPC provider instead of relying on an external one.

If at some point, Unstoppable wallet is not working as expected users can easily migrate their wallets to some other non-custodial wallet app.

### Longer answer:

Your funds and information are not ‘in’ Unstoppable. Your wallet exists on the blockchain itself, and UW just offers a way for anyone to interact with the blockchain easily. If UW went down, you would simply have to find another Ethereum blockchain interface that would allow you to access your wallet.

The information used to unlock your UW wallet is the same information that can be used to unlock your wallet on another platform. We always suggest doing research before entering your information into an unfamiliar site.
