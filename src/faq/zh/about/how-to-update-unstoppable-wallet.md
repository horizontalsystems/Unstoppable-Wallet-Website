# How to update Unstoppable Wallet?

The Unstoppable is constantly a work in progress and therefore it's recommended to always use the latest version of the wallet app.

Always update the app by downloading it from one of the official resources. Being an open source wallet app means that anyone can replicate the Unstoppable wallet and distribute their own version (potentially modified) of the app.


Both Android and iOS allows for automatic app updates which would ensure that the device always runs the latest version of the Unstoppable app, without having to update it manually every few weeks.
