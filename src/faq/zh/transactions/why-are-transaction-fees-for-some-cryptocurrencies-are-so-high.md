# Why are transaction fees for some cryptocurrencies are so high?

The transaction fee amount depends on multiple factors with the most important being the busyness and the capacity of the blockchain network for the given cryptocurrency at any given time.

When a lot of people are transacting on a cryptocurrency network that's limited in its throughput, the network gets congested causing the average fees to rise. Transaction fees serve as a priority ordering mechanism in times when there are more transactions taking place on the network than can be processed (resulting in a backlog).

Transactions paying higher fees get prioritized while those with low fees remain on the wait line. Sending a transaction with a very low fee during busy times likely results in the transaction staying pending for hours/days or even being rejected (as it never happened).

Different cryptocurrency blockchains have different throughput capacity and usage levels. Therefore transaction fees tend to be a lot more expensive on popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum which also happen to be limited in throughput.

The fees on busy blockchains may change significantly within hours depending on the market events and news. Typically, blockchains where transactions are cheap either have a high throughput (EOS, Solana or Binance Smart Chain) or low usage levels (Litecoin or Doge).
