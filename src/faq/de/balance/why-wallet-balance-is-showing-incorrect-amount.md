# Why wallet balance is showing incorrect amount?

There are several potential reasons for the wallet balance to display incorrect amount:
- when the exchange rate for the given cryptocurrency is missing, its value is not reflected in the total balance amount.
- when the exchange rate for the given cryptocurrency is incorrect the shown balance for that coin as well as the total balance amount will be displayed incorrectly.
- hen the app synchronizes itself with the blockchain the balance for coins as well as total balance amount will keep changing depending on the synchronization progress.

In some cases the balance amount for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash and Zcash cryptocurrencies may be shown incorrectly as a result of Unstoppable wallet failing to correctly identify an incoming transaction on the blockchain.

In such cases you're welcome to report the issue to the Unstoppable team and wait for the fix. It will be addressed on a priority basis.
