# Why transaction value shown incorrectly in recent transaction?

To be able to display the overall transferred amount in USD, EUR etc for past crypto transactions Unstoppable needs to know the valid exchange rate at the date of transaction. Unstoppable relies on Coingecko.com for that data.

If the historical exchange rate provided by the source happens to be incorrect then the transaction amount shown in the transactions list will be shown incorrectly as well. In such cases always refer to the actual amount transferred in cryptocurrency.
