# What steps to take if I lost my phone?

In cases when a phone with the wallet app is lost or no longer available the wallet owner can get a new device and restore access to the wallet on a new device.

However, if the original device didn't have the unlock code mechanism in place for the device and/or the wallet app or if unlock code used were easy to guess i.e. 000000, 123456 then its advised to restore wallet on a new device and transfer the funds there by sending transactions from the old to a new wallet.
