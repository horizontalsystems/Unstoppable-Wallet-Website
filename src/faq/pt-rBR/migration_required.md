# MIGRATION REQUIRED

It looks like this wallet was created in a non-standard manner. While the wallet works in the Unstoppable app and is secure it is not a standard-compliant wallet and is not compatible with other standard-compliant wallet apps.

As a result, restoring access to this wallet in other wallet apps will not be possible. It's recommended to set up a new wallet using an English wordlist and transfer all funds to that new wallet.

- Go to the Settings tab
- Select Manage Wallets
- Click on Create button
- Make sure to Backup the newly created wallet
- Transfer funds from the old wallet to the new wallet

Until you have completed the process make sure to keep a backup of your old wallet as well.
