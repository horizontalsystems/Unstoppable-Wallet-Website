# How does Unstoppable make money?

Unstoppable is a free to use instrument that keeps all of its fundamental features free.

We are a self-funded group and not dependent on any funding from external entities. Our former ventures allow us to stay independent, creative and experimental, while building our preferred asset management instrument for the decentralized fintech.

As per our roadmap, starting from version 0.24 - 0.25 , the wallet app is going to start integrating premium features for power users, i.e:

- advanced on-chain analytics
- advanced alerting features
- VIP support over private chats
- advanced DeFi yield generation tools

The features above are already in the implementation stage, and are designed to enable the Unstoppable team to monetize itself and financially operate in DAO format moving forward.

Premium wallet features are expected to be available only to those holding special Unstoppable wallet tokens.
