# Why are transaction fees for some cryptocurrencies so high?

The transaction fee amount depends on multiple factors with the most important being the business and the capacity of the blockchain network for the given cryptocurrency.

When a lot of people are transacting on a cryptocurrency network that's limited in throughput, the network can get quickly congested causing the average fees to rise. Transaction fees serve as a priority ordering mechanism in times when there are more transactions taking place on the network than can be processed (resulting in a backlog).

Transactions paying higher fees get prioritized while those with low fees remain on the wait line. Sending a transaction with a low fee during busy times likely result in the transaction staying pending for hours/days or getting rejected by the network.

Different cryptocurrency blockchains have different throughput capacity and usage levels. Therefore, transaction fees tend to be a lot more expensive on popular blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum which also happen to be fairly limited in throughput.

The fees on busy blockchains may change significantly within hours depending on the market events and news. Typically, blockchains where transactions are cheap either have a high throughput (Solana or Binance Smart Chain) or low usage levels (Litecoin or Doge).
