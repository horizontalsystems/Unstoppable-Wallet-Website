# Is it safe to share a payment address with others?

Users need to share their payment address with anyone they're expecting to get paid from.

Things to keep in mind:

- Anyone who knows someone's Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain address can potentially see the entire transaction history and current token balances (ERC20, BEP20 etc) for that address. Ethereum and alike blockchains are fully public in that regard.

- When it comes to semi-anonymous blockchains i.e. Bitcoin and alike derivatives (Bitcoin Cash, Doge, Litecoin, etc) sharing payment address doesn't mean that user's past transactions and wallet balances are going to be visible to the sender. That's because, most non-custodial wallets would provide user with a new payment address after each successful incoming payment.

- The privacy risks are minimal when transacting with privacy coins such as Zcash, Monero or Dash.
