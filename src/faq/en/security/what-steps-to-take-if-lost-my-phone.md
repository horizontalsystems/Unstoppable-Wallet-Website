# What steps should I take if I lose my phone?

In cases when a phone with the wallet app is lost or no longer available the wallet owner can get a new device and restore access to the wallet on a new device.

However, if the original device didn't have the unlock code mechanism in place for the device and/or the wallet app or if unlock codes used were easy to guess (i.e. 000000 or 123456) then it's advised to:

1. restore old wallet on a new device
2. set up a new wallet on a new device
3. transfer funds from old to a new wallet
