# Are there any limitations to swap amounts?

Users can swap as much cryptocurrency as they want, given there is enough liquidity on a DEX.

Users are strongly advised to review the swap risks before executing a swap transaction.

It should also be noted that the amount of available liquidity on a decentralized exchange may be insufficient to cover some large trades, especially when the trade involves some unpopular token.

Therefore, users are encouraged to compare the swap price with some other centralized exchange (ex: [Binance](https://binance.com)) before executing a trade.
