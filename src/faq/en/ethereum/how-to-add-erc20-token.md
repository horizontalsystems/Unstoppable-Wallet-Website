# How to add an ERC20 token to a balance

Users may add any Ethereum-based ERC20 token to the wallet using the Coin Manager icon on the balance tab.

From the Coin Manager screen, users may either search (and activate the coin) or add it manually via the Add Token option.

To add the token manually, users need to know its ERC20 contract address.
