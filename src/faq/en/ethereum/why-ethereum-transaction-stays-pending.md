# Why does a Ethereum transaction stay pending?

There are two potential reasons a transaction may remain in a pending state for an extended period of time.

The transaction fee is below the network average: This is the most common reason for a transaction to remain in a pending state. In such cases, transactions get confirmed after the network becomes less busy.

If there is another pending transaction from the same user: Ethereum transactions are processed in sequence and if there is a pending transaction, it needs to be completed (or replaced) first before other transactions from the same user can take place.
