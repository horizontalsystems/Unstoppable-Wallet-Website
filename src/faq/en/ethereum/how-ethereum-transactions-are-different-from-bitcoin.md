# How are Ethereum transactions different from Bitcoin?

Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can take many forms, going well beyond plain ETH transfers from one address to another.

Being a blockchain designed for programmable money, an Ethereum transaction can have many steps involving conditional logic and interaction with various smart contracts.

Currently, there are smart contracts which operate as lending/borrowing facilities, crypto exchange services, lottery contracts and so on. The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically to write and execute smart contracts.

For instance, there can be a transaction which takes the following multiple steps within a single transaction:

1. User borrows X amount of token Y from lending smart_contract_1
2. Trades borrowed Y tokens for W tokens on exchange smart_contract_2
3. Trades W tokens for Y tokens on other exchange smart_contract_3
4. Returns borrowed Y tokens to lending smart_contract_1

The 4 steps above can all be part of a single transaction. Such transactions can be made by someone looking to benefit from arbitrage opportunities between different decentralized crypto exchanges running on Ethereum.

So, transactions on Ethereum may consist of several steps and involve value exchanges between several smart contract entities.
