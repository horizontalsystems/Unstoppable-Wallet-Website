# When is an Ethereum transaction considered final and irreversible?

While an Ethereum transaction is considered completed/confirmed once it has been included in the blockchain, it's not considered final until a few more blocks have been added to the blockchain after it.

In order for a transaction to be considered final and permanent, it's recommended to wait 11 more blocks (about 3 minutes) after the block holding the transaction is added to the blockchain.
