# Why are Ethereum transactions so expensive?

Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can take many forms going well beyond plain ETH transfers from one address to another.

Some example of transaction types:

- a transfer of ETH from one address to another
- a transfer of ERC20 tokens from one address to another
- exchanging of ERC20 tokens to another ERC20 token
- borrowing of some ERC20 tokens from a borrowing service

All kinds of transactions can occur on the Ethereum blockchain. The key parameter that affects the transaction fee for different transactions at any given moment is the complexity of the individual transaction.

- The more complex a transaction is, the more computational steps it has.
- The more computational steps there are, the higher the fee is for the transaction.

Keeping in mind the above, the simplest and cheapest transaction type on Ethereum is the plain transfer of Ethereum tokens.

At the same time, a transaction that exchanges one token to another is more complex and typically costs several times more than sending ETH tokens to someone. The transaction fee doesn't depend on the amount of Ethereum or tokens being transacted.
