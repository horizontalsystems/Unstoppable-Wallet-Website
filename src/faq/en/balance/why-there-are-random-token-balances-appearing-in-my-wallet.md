# Why are there random token balances appearing in my wallet?

It's not uncommon for some new cryptocurrency projects to 'airdrop' (giveaway) tokens representing the new project to the community. This is done to attract community interest and spread the distribution of tokens. There are also those that do it purely for spam purposes.

While some projects airdrop tokens to selected users based on some criteria others may do it to everyone who has any Ethereum cryptocurrency on balance. Everyone's Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send ETH and/or tokens to these addresses without any preconditions.

While occasionally users get some quality tokens this way (i.e. Uniswap or 1inch airdrop) which may quickly appreciate in value, for the most part, the airdropped tokens have no value and can be ignored.
