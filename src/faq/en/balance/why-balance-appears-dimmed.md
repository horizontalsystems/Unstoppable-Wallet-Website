# Why does the balance appear dimmed?

In cases when the app doesn't have access to fresh cryptocurrency exchange rates, the wallet balance value appears dimmed. Typically, cryptocurrency rates are considered outdated if they are older than 10 minutes.

The balance value may also appear dimmed when one or more cryptocurrencies in the Balance tab are being synchronized with the blockchain.

During regular usage cases, it's expected for the balance to appear dimmed for a brief moment during app launch as the wallet completes synchronization jobs.

If any of the coins donâ€™t have a current exchange rate then it won't be included in the total balance amount on the Balance tab.
