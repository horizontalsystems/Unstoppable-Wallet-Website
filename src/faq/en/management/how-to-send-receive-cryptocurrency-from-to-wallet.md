# How do you send/receive cryptocurrency?

Almost all non-custodial wallets are designed in a similar way when it comes to sending or receiving cryptocurrencies.

For a detailed overview for Bitcoin or Ethereum transfers refer to respective sections below.

To receive or deposit cryptocurrency:

- First step is to activate the coin on the Balance tab via the 'add coin' button if it's not already active.
- Then proceed to the Balance tab and obtain the receive/deposit address for the coin by clicking on the 'receive' icon button on the coin cell.
- The resulting screen shows the user's payment address for that coin. When someone sends a given coin to that address the funds will appear on the wallet's Balance tab.
- Double-check payment address when passing it to other entities to ensure the provided address to the sender is correct. If the payment is made to the wrong address it's not possible to cancel it.

To send cryptocurrency:

- Click on the cryptocurrency coin on the Balance tab and proceed with the 'send' button.
- Provide the destination address (payment address of the recipient), enter the amount and set the fee value for the transaction. For ease of use, the input field for entering the amount allows specifying the amount in fiat equivalent.
- Click on proceed for final confirmation screen. Pay attention to the values on that screen and make sure the amounts being sent are correct.
- Confirm the transaction to send it to the blockchain for processing.
