# MIGRATION RECOMMENDED

It looks like this wallet was created using a non-English word list and/or has a symbol in the passphrase other than the ones listed below:

A-Z a-z 0-9 '"`&/?!:;.,~*$=+-{}<>\_#@|%

If your wallet balance and transactions are showing as expected you don't have to do anything. However, if you do not see a balance or transactions then you need to restore your wallet via the non-standard restore option.

1. Go to the Settings tab
2. Select Manage Wallets
3. Click on the Restore button
4. Select Non-standard Restore
5. Complete restore steps

Upon completion your balance and transactions should become visible.

At this point, the wallet app will show you another alert with recommendation steps to move funds to a standard compliant wallet.
