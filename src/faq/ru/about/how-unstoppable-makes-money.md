# How Unstoppable makes money?

Unstoppable is a free to use instrument that keeps all of its fundamental features free.

We are a self funded group and not dependent on funding from external entities. Our former ventures/investments allow us to stay independent, creative and experimental.

As per our roadmap, starting from version 0.24 , the wallet app going to start integrating premium features for power users i.e:

- advanced on-chain analytics
- advanced alerting features
- VIP level support over direct chat
- blockchain tech consulting

The features above are already in the implementation stage and designed to enable the Unstoppable team to monetize itself and financially operate in DAO format moving forward.

Premium wallet features are expected to be available only to those holding Unstoppable Tokens on the wallet balance.
