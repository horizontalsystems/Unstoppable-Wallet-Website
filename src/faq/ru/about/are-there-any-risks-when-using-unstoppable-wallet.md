# Are there any risks when using Unstoppable Wallet

Unstoppable Wallet has no means to interfere with the user's funds or in any way restrict the user from using the app. The wallet user is the only entity in control of the funds.
As a result of being non-custodial, private and decentralized, Unstoppable brings full power in the hands of the user. With the exclusive control over assets users also get full responsibility. There is no custodian entity responsible for the safety of the funds other than users themselves. In case there are issues there is no one to compensate for losses.
For the most part, key wallet features do not depend on any centrally managed servers or any infrastructure managed by the Unstoppable team.
Potential risks include:

- Unexpected Software Bugs

  Unstoppable has an open code allowing any entity to examine and verify that wallet app works as expected. It's potentially possible for the wallet to have undiscovered issues which may lead to unexpected behavior in the app.


- Poor Security Practices

  Problems which may originate from users' side as a result of poor security practices i.e. rooting phone, not having PIN lock, keeping the operating system outdated, installing apps from unauthorized sources, clicking on unknown links while, clicking on ads on adult sites etc. Also, users should never share wallet private keys (aka 12-24 word mnemonic phrase) with anyone, incl. Unstoppable team. All potential problems with the wallet app can be addressed without the need for a wallet private key.


- Using unofficial Unstoppable app

  Always update the app by downloading it from one of the official resources. Being an open source wallet app means that anyone can replicate the Unstoppable wallet and distribute their own version (potentially modified) of the app.


- Incorrect Metadata

  Incorrect metadata in the app i.e. app displaying outdated exchange rates. Unstoppable needs to know current market rates for the given fiat currency in order to display cryptocurrency balance in USD, EUR, AUD etc . While these rates are obtained from reputable 3rd party sources, Unstoppable can not guarantee they do not differ from global market rates. Therefore, when sending someone a large amount in cryptocurrency it's safer to enter the payment amount in cryptocurrency (when entering the amount into the input form) rather than in its fiat equivalent.
