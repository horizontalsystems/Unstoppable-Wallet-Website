# How to delete (unlink) the wallet?

To delete wallet(s) and related data from Unstoppable:

- Go to Settings >> Manage Wallets section of the app.
- Click on the 'more' button next to the wallet to access its settings.
- Use the 'unlink' button on the settings screen to complete the procedure.

The steps above will delete the wallet from the app and erase all of its data from the app as though it never existed. This action doesn't delete the wallet transactions, balances from a blockchain as it's not possible to do so.

The unlink action merely deletes the private key controlling the wallet from the Unstoppable app. To restore a deleted wallet in the future the users require the private key (or mnemonic phrase) associated with it. Restoring access to a deleted wallet without knowing its private key (or mnemonic phrase) is impossible.
