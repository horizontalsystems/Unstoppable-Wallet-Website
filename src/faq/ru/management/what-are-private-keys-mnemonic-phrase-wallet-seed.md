# What are private keys, mnemonic phrase, wallet seed etc ?

Usually following terms are used interchangeably in cryptocurrency context. All these terms typically refer to information that is used to control funds on the non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets like Unstoppable.
 
For simplicity, users may think of them as the username/password needed to access wallets they are associated with. Every non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet is expected to provide users with a private key that's not stored anywhere online or shared by anyone.

In contrast to traditional services that provide ability to recover lost passwords/usernames, non-custodial wallets do not provide capability to recover private keys and are unable to do so.

The private keys are randomly generated on the user's device during the wallet creation process and never leave the device after that. So, recovering a private key from elsewhere is impossible if for some reason the wallet user is unable to access it on the device. That's why wallets prompt private key backup steps after the wallet has just been created.
