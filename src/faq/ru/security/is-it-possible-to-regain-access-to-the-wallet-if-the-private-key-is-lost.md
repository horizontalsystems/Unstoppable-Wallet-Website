# Is it possible to regain access to the wallet if the private key is lost?

No, accessing the wallet funds is only possible if the user has access to the private key.

Unstoppable is merely an interface/door that allows its users to easily interact with blockchains and cryptocurrencies operating in them.

The ability to control and spend cryptocurrency on these blockchains is done via wallet private keys which reside on Unstoppable wallets. These private keys never leave the Unstoppable wallet app and remain solely in usersâ€™ hands.

It's the responsibility of the user to keep them backed up and protected from unauthorized entities. This also means, Unstoppable is not able to:

- Recover wallet private key for the user if its lost
- Cancel user's transactions, or even know about them
- Interfere with user's tokens or access to the app in anyway
