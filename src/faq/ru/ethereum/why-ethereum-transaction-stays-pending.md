# Why Ethereum transaction stays pending?

There are two potential reasons a transaction may remain in pending state for an extended period of time.

The transaction fee is below the network average. This is the most common reason for a transaction to remain in pending state. In such cases, transactions get confirmed after the network becomes less busy.

When there is another pending transaction that was sent earlier. Ethereum transactions are processed in sequence and if there is a pending transaction, it needs to be completed (or replaced) first before other transactions from the same user can take place.
