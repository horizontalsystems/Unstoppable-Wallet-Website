# What are ERC20 tokens?

A term cryptocurrency usually refers to native currency unit within some blockchain. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both native cryptocurrencies on their respective blockchains.

Some blockchains like Ethereum provide means to create other cryptocurrencies for all kinds of purposes. Such cryptocurrencies are typically referred to as cryptocurrency tokens.

Ethereum blockchain is foremost a platform that enables creation of autonomous services powered by smart contracts. Some of the popular services include:

- Uniswap >> token exchange service
- MakerDAO >> borrowing service
- Synthetix >> derivatives trading service

The services on Ethereum can take many forms and have different use cases. Some of these services issue internal cryptocurrency tokens that can be used for things like service governance, voting or profit sharing.

- Uniswap has UNI token
- MakeDAO has MKR token
- Synthetix has SNX token

As Ethereum started growing in popularity there was a need for a common token standard and that's how ERC20 token standard emerged.

Today, there are many ERC20 tokens around and anyone with sufficient skills can create one. These tokens make up over half of cryptocurrencies around and being traded on cryptocurrency exchanges just like Ethereum or Bitcoin. In many ways, ERC20 tokens are a decentralized equivalent of 'company shares' in the blockchain world.

The value of some ERC20 token depends on what capabilities it provides to the owner. For instance, a token that gives someone the ability to claim profits from an Ethereum-based autonomous service would obviously increase in price as that service grows in popularity and generates profits for its token holders.

The ERC20 is a most common token standard that is being used by many Ethereum services when creating internal tokens. It outlines what base characteristics and capabilities a token should have, how token balances should be tracked, how transfers should work, and so on.
