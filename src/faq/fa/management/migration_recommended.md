# MIGRATION RECOMMENDED

It looks like this wallet is not standard compliant because it was created using a non-English word list and/or has a symbol in the passphrase other than ones listed below:

A-Z a-z 0-9 ' "`&/?!:;.,~*$=+-[](){}<>\_#@|%

If your wallet balance and transactions are showing as expected you don't have to do anything. However, if you do not see a balance or transactions then you need to restore your wallet via the non-standard restore option.

- Go to the Settings tab
- Select Manage Wallets
- Click on the Restore button
- Select Non-standard Restore
- Complete restore steps

Upon completion, your balance and transactions should become visible.

At this point, the wallet app will show you another alert with recommendation steps to move funds to a standard-compliant wallet.
