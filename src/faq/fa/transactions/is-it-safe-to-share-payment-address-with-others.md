# Is it safe to share payment address with others?

Yes, users have to share their payment address with anyone they're expecting to pay them.

Keep in mind that anyone who knows the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain address of someone can potentially see the entire transaction history and current token balances(ERC20, BEP20 etc) for that address.
