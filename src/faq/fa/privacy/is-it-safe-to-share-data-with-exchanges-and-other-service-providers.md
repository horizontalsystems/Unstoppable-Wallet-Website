# Is it safe to share data with exchanges and other service providers?

Nearly all regulated cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers are required to conduct extensive Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks for each customer they work with.

The extent of information requested by these service providers changes depending on various factors incl. customer's location, service provider location and its business nature. Anyone expecting to deal with large amounts of cryptocurrency should be expected to go through such checks with cryptocurrency exchanges, banks etc.

Some points to keep in mind:

- the business entity conducting a check may get compromised and leak users' private data as a result. Therefore, preference should be given to more established entities.
- the business entity conducting a check may (have to) share the information about the user with other entities. Those looking for privacy in that regard, may look for service providers lying outside their own jurisdiction.
