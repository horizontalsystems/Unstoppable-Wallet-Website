# What the lock sign next to coin balance means?

In some cases Unstoppable displays a lock icon below the balance amount for the coin. This happens when the wallet app is not able to spend the entire balance for a given coin.
Such cases include:

- when someone sends you time-locked Bitcoins which can not be spent until a certain date in the future. Unstoppable and some other smart Bitcoin wallets provide such features.
- when a certain amount of time needs to pass before the recently received amount becomes spendable. This usually varies between a few minutes to an hour, depending on the cryptocurrency.
