# Why balance appears dimmed?

In cases when the app doesn't have access to fresh cryptocurrency exchange rates the wallet balance amount appears dimmed. Typically, the rates are considered outdated if they are older than 10 minutes.

Balance amount may also appear dimmed when one or more cryptocurrencies in the Balance tab are being synchronized with the blockchain.

During regular usage cases, it's expected for the balance to appear dimmed for a brief moment during app launch/open as the wallet completes synchronization jobs.

If any of the coins doesn't have an exchange rate for it then it won't be included in the total balance amount at the top of the Balance tab.
