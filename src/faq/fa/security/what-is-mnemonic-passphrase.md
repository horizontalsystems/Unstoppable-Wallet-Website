# What is a mnemonic passphrase?

As enhanced security measures, some non-custodial wallets provide a way to secure a 12-24 word mnemonic phrase with an additional password phrase (aka mnemonic passphrase).

In such cases, the wallet user is required to backup both mnemonic phrases and an additional passphrase. Both of them will be needed to restore access to the wallet.

Having a mnemonic passphrase adds an additional security layer to a wallet by keeping it safe even if someone manages to find a mnemonic phrase. Using mnemonic passphrase is like adding two-factor authentication to your crypto wallet.

The beauty of a passphrase is, itâ€™s usually one word and you can store it in your head. That is why this feature is powerful and has the potential to save your funds even in the worst case where your mnemonic phrase is stolen and seen by others.
