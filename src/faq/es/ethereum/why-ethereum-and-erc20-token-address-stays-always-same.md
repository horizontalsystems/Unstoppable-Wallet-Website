# Why Ethereum and ERC20 token address stays always same?

In contrast to Bitcoin where the user's payment address changes after each incoming transaction, the Ethereum payment address for the individual wallet stays always the same.

Therefore, someone's address to receive ETH or some Ethereum-based token would always be the same.

While certain privacy-focused wallets can enable its owner to use multiple addresses by default Ethereum blockchain is designed with an assumption that each wallet uses a single address.
