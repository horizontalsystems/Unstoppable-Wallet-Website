# Why Ethereum transactions are so expensive?

Transactions on Ethereum blockchain can take many forms going well beyond plain ETH transfers from one address to another.

Some example transaction types:

- transfer of ETH from one address to another
- transfer of some token from one address to another
- trading one token for another token
- borrowing tokens from a borrowing service

There can be all kinds of transactions on Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum blockchain doesn't put any limitations given that transaction sender pays to the network for executing transaction steps. The key parameter that affects the transaction fee for different transactions at any given moment is the complexity of the individual transaction.

The more complex a transaction is, the more computational steps it has. The more computational steps there are, the higher is the fee for that transaction.

Keeping in mind above, the simplest and cheapest transaction type on Ethereum is plain transfer of Ethereum tokens.

At the same time, a transaction that exchanges one token to another is more complex and typically costs several times more than sending ETH tokens to someone. The transaction fee doesn't depend on the amount of ETH or tokens being transacted.
