# Is it safe to share Ethereum receive address with others?

While users are expected to share Ethereum payment addresses with anyone from whom they want to receive a payment, there are some privacy concerns to keep in mind.

Sharing Ethereum addresses with others has privacy issues as the other party can potentially see ETH and all ERC20 token balances for that address as well as its past transactions.

Therefore, to protect privacy some users keep multiple Ethereum wallets and use them for various purposes. 

There can be one wallet for transacting with others and some other wallet for long term asset storage.
