# What is an Ethereum Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a program that's pre-programmed to do something and can't do anything outside that logic. These programs typically remain independent and unalterable by anyone (even its creator) after they have been deployed on Ethereum blockchain. 

Think of smart contracts as autonomous robots that were designed to do just one thing and can't do anything outside that design. The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically as platform for smart contracts. 

Currently, there are autonomous smart contracts managing billions worth of cryptocurrency. These include services such as: 

- lending/borrowing facilities,
- crypto exchange services,
- lottery contracts,
- decentralized autonomous organizations
- ...

These smart contract powered services can't be taken down as they are hosted on the blockchain itself. 

At the same time, it's impossible to sue or censor a smart contract even if operates billions in unregulated manner. A smart contract can be programmed and launched by anyone (anonymously) and might not be connected to any physical entity. 

The Ethereum blockchain is a globally accessible and permissionless platform for smart contracts. Anyone can privately create a whatever smart contract and deploy it to the blockchain to provide some financial or other kind of service to anyone globally.
