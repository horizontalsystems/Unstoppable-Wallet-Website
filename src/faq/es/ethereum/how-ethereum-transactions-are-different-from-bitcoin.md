# How Ethereum transactions are different from Bitcoin?

Transactions on Ethereum blockchain can take many forms going well beyond plain ETH transfers from one address to another.

Being a blockchain designed for programmable money a transaction on Ethereum can take many forms and have many steps involving conditional logic and interaction with other smart contracts. Currently, there are smart contracts which operate as lending/borrowing facilities, crypto exchange services, lottery contracts etc. 

For instance, there can be a transaction which takes following steps within a single transaction:

1. User borrows X amount of token Y from a lending service smart_contract_1
2. User trades borrowed Y tokens to for W tokens on exchange service smart_contract_2
3. Then user sells W tokens for Y tokens on other exchange service smart_contract_3
4. Returns borrowed Y tokens to a lending smart_contract_1
5. Keeps remaining X tokens to self as profit.

The multiple steps above can all be part of a single transaction. Such transactions can be made by someone looking to benefit from arbitrage opportunities between different decentralized crypto exchanges running on Ethereum.

So, transactions on Ethereum may consist of several steps and involve value exchange between several smart contract entities.
