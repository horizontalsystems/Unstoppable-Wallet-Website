# Who is building Unstoppable Wallet?

Unstoppable started in 2017 and is being built by Horizontal Systems.

- We are a 15-people engineering and creative team with an inherent passion for borderless fintech and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

- We are no strangers to building complex software projects and the bulk of our engineering experience comes from designing and building high-load backend and mobile-first client systems.

- While the team has been involved in various SaaS ventures and fintech since 2013, we transitioned to the cryptocurrency and decentralized fintech domain professionally in 2017. This was primarily a result of experiencing highly limiting problems when dealing with traditional finance layers.

The idea to build a multi-chain wallet app presented an opportunity to learn the cryptocurrency tech stack and create a capital management instrument that lives outside the traditional finance layer.
