# Why the exchange rate for the token not shown?

Unstoppable obtains token exchange rates from multiple third party sources which track market prices in real time.

The current and historical rates for some tokens may not be available, especially for newly launched tokens. In such cases, Unstoppable will not display the exchange rate for the coin.
