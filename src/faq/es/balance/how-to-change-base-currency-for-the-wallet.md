# How to change base currency for the wallet?

By default Unstoppable displays all balance and transaction amounts in USD base currency. Users are able to change base currency from wallet Settings.

The exchange rates are provided by a 3rd party service. While Unstoppable works with reliable data providers (i.e. https://coingecko.com) the wallet has no means to guarantee that returned rates are always valid real time rates.
