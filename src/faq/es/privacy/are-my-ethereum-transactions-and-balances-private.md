# Are my Ethereum transactions and balances private?

Every transaction done by an address (user) on Ethereum blockchain is visible to anyone monitoring the blockchain.

Furthermore, given any address it's possible to lookup its past transactions as well as its current Ethereum and ERC20 token balances. Everything the account was ever up to.

The only remaining privacy element here is the lack of connection between Ethereum address and a person's real world identity.

A good privacy practice when it comes to Ethereum is to use multiple wallets with clearly defined use cases:

- a rarely-used wallet for long storage that never transacts with entities that collect data.
- a wallet for transacting with exchanges etc
- a wallet for transacting with people

With a right approach and some due diligence on the part of the user some level of privacy can be achieved on Ethereum.
