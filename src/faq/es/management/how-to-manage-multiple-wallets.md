# How to manage multiple-wallets?

Unstoppable enables easy management for an unlimited number of multi-coin crypto wallets.

Users are able to manage and operate as many wallets as necessary where each wallet can serve as an asset portfolio. For instance, one wallet can hold long term investments, another wallet for payments and so on.

The Balance tab on Unstoppable always shows the currently active wallet. To switch between activated wallets users may use the wallet switcher button located in the top left section of the Balance tab. Alternatively, this can be done via Settings >> Manage Wallets screen.

When operating multiple wallets users are expected to complete the backup procedure for all wallets.
