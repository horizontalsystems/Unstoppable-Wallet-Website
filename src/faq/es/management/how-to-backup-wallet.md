# How to backup wallet(s)?

Wallet backup is one of the most important steps. Make sure you follow instructions and complete backup steps for each wallet in the Unstoppable app.

- Go to Settings >> Manage Wallets section of the app.
- To access wallet settings, click on the 'more' button next to the wallet you need to backup. All wallets where backup procedure has not been completed have a red alert icon.
- In the settings screen for the given wallet, click on the "Backup Wallet" option and complete backup steps.

You will not be able to receive funds to the non-backed up wallet. While some users found this inconvenient it was put in place to minimize cases where users operate wallets without having backups.

The backup procedure for each wallet consists of writing down a private key (in a form of 12-24 words, aka mnemonic phrase) for a given wallet.

Please note that saving a screenshot of a private key for the wallet is not considered a safe practice. Any 3rd party application that has permission to access a photo library on a device (i.e. social apps) can potentially access that screenshot and share it with unauthorized entities.
