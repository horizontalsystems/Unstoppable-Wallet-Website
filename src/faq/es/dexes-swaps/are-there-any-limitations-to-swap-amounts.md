# Are there any limitations to swap amounts?

No. Users can swap as much as they want. For larger orders (above 10,000$) users are strongly advised to review the swap price before executing a swap transaction.

It should be noted that the amount of available liquidity on decentralized exchanges may be insufficient to cover some large trades, especially when the trade involves some unpopular token. Therefore, users are encouraged to compare the swap price with some other centralized exchange (ex: Binance) before executing a trade.
