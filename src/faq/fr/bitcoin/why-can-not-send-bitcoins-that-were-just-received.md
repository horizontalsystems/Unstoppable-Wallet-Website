# Why can't send Bitcoins that were just received?

In Unstoppable, for a transaction recipient to be able to spend newly received Bitcoins, the transaction should receive 3 confirmations on the blockchain. Only after the transaction has received 3 confirmations Unstoppable makes it possible to use received funds in new transactions.

Given that the original transaction has sufficient fee this should take 30-40 min since transaction was sent. The confirmation counts can be tracked within the Unstoppable app or via public Bitcoin block explorer using the ID of the transaction.
