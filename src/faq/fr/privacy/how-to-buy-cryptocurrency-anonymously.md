# How to buy cryptocurrency anonymously?

Purchasing cryptocurrency for fiat currency anonymously is difficult, especially for someone looking to purchase in large amounts.

- The only way to purchase cryptocurrency anonymously is by buying it from someone directly or by using P2P cryptocurrency exchanges.

- A less private way would be to buy using a cryptocurrency exchange incorporated outside user's jurisdiction or a service i.e. Tether limited (https://tether.to).

- Buying one cryptocurrency using some other cryptocurrency anonymously is possible and can be done through decentralized exchanges i.e. Uniswap or Sushiswap using Unstoppable and similar DeFi wallets.
