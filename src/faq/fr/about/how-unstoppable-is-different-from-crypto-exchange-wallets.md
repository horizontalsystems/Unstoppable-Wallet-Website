# How Unstoppable is different from crypto exchange wallets?

Most of the wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex are of custodial type. These are not real cryptocurrency wallets and do not provide any level of independence, privacy or control over the funds.

In practical terms, the users of these wallets:

- fully dependent on exchange to be able to access their funds
- can lose access to their wallet at sole discretion of exchange
- can lose their funds if exchange gets hacked
- have little control over their privacy (data can get leaked)
- have to go through identity checks and KYC/AML procedures

When a user uses a non-custodial wallet like Unstoppable the control over funds and access to them doesn't depend on the exchange or any other entity. The user has unconditional and uninterruptible access to funds.
