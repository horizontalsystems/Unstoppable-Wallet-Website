# What is an Ethereum Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a program that's preprogrammed to do something and can't do anything outside that logic. These programs are programmed and typically remain independent and unalterable by anyone (even its creator) after they have been deployed (began to operate) on Ethereum blockchain. 

Think of smart contracts as autonomous robots that were designed to do just one thing and can't do anything outside that design. The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically as platform for smart contracts. 

Currently, there are autonomous smart contracts managing billions worth of cryptocurrency and autonomously operate as: 

- lending/borrowing facilities,
- crypto exchange services,
- lottery contracts,
- decentralized autonomous organizations,
- ...

These smart contract powered services can't be taken down as they are hosted on the blockchain itself. At the same time, it's impossible to sue or censor smart contract even if operates billions in unregulated manner, because there is no physical entity behind it. 

The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically to host smart contracts. Anyone can privately create a whatever smart contract and deploy it to the blockchain to provide public service without any preconditions.
