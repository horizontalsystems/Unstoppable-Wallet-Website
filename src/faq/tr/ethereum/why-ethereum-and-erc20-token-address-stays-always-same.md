# Why Ethereum and ERC20 token address stays always same?

In contrast to Bitcoin where the user's payment address changes after each incoming transaction, the Ethereum payment address for the individual wallet stays always the same.

It should be also noted that someone's address to receive ETH or some ERC20 tokens would always be the same.
