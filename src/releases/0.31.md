# Version 0.31 Highlights

ADDRESS BOOK, ADVANCED ANALYTICS, UI IMPROVEMENTS, FANTOM CHAIN

GM free souls! Another massive update is here. This time we bring two major new features and some extensive UI improvements.

## ADDRESS BOOK

Now the wallet has an address book feature. Users can now save payment addresses they interact with regularly i.e. deposit addresses to crypto exchanges.

Address book contacts are stored locally and can be optionally synced to iCloud (iOS users) or exported to a file on a device.

## ADVANCED ANALYTICS

The coin analytics tab has been massively redesigned and expanded to include coin rank for the following metrics:

- centralized exchange volume rank
- decentralized exchange volume rank
- decentralized exchange liquidity rank
- active addresses rank
- transaction count rank
- project revenue rank

This feature is available for free at this point. It's expected to receive further improvements in the coming releases and be available only to premium users. Make sure to check it out.

## UI IMPROVEMENTS

Several pages throughout the app have been redesigned for further clarity and a cleaner interface.

- coin page
- coin manager
- wallet watch screens
- wallet management
- send BTC/ETH pages
- transaction info

## FANTOM CHAIN

The Fantom chain was added to the list of supported chains.

Enjoy and Peace!
