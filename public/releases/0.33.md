# Version 0.33 Highlights

TRON SUPPORT, BACKUP SEED, SWAP IMPROVEMENTS, ANALYTICS IMPROVEMENTS

GM free souls! Here comes another significant upgrade to the Unstoppable Wallet app.

## TRON SUPPORT

In this release, we finally introduced full support for Tron blockchain. This has been one of the most requested features on our Githab and couldn't be postponed any further.

Unstoppable wallet users are now able to:

- store/send/receive TRX cryptocurrency
- import Tron wallets from other wallet apps
- store/send/receive tokens issued on the Tron blockchain

Expect native TRX staking ability in the coming releases. We might also integrate DEX swap for Tron assets if there is a significant demand for the feature.

## BACKUP SEED

Wallet users are now able to have encrypted backups of all wallets to some external storage medium.

While this feature should be used with care power users are likely to find it immensely helpful. The backups are encrypted with a user-provided password.

## SWAP IMPROVEMENTS

This release also brings full integration of Uniswap v3! Enjoy the latest capabilities of the largest decentralized exchange without leaving an Unstoppable wallet.

## PREMIUM ANALYTICS

The coin analytics section has been upgraded to include the coin's rank based on the number of wallets holding the respective coin.

Enjoy and Peace!
