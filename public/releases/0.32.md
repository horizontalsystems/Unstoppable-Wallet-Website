# Version 0.32 Highlights

BITCOIN TAPROOT, ZCASH UPGRADE,  ECASH SUPPORT

GM free souls! This release is a bit smaller than usual and heavily focused on Bitcoin protocol.

## BITCOIN TAPROOT (BTC)

Unstoppable Wallet now supports Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade and allows the creation of Taproot-enabled Bitcoin wallets (BIP86).

Taproot is considered the most significant Bitcoin upgrade over the last 5 years. There are no visual changes to the wallet UI other than an addition of the new wallet type during the wallet setup process.

## ZCASH UPGRADE (ZEC)

The library powering Zcash (ZEC) cryptocurrency has been upgraded. This is the major upgrade from the folks building the Zcash protocol and Unstoppable is one of the very first wallets implementing it.

The upgrade fixes a lot of issues that were reported previously and overall provides a smoother and faster experience when interacting with the Zcash blockchain.

## ECASH SUPPORT (XEC)

This release brings support to eCash cryptocurrency, formerly known as Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA). This has been widely requested by some of our most vocal supporters and we are happy to get it in place.

The eCash (XEC) shares a lot of Bitcoin fundamentals and aims to be used as a means of transaction used to pay for goods and services.

Enjoy and Peace!
