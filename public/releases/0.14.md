## Version 0.14 Highlights

This release includes new features, UI improvements for onboarding new users, privacy improvements, bug fixes and significant performance upgrades throughout the app.

### Added / Removed Tokens
wBTC and wETH ERC20 tokens were added. Removed the Aurora DAO token as the token currently known as IDEX and already present in the app.

### Privacy Control Center
The dedicated privacy control screen got a face lift. Plus a new info screen was added where each privacy setting is explained in detail. Some of the settings which are not relevant for users creating new wallets are no longer accessible for them.

### Top 100 Crypto
The app lock screen now displays top 100 coin rankings from CoinMarketCap.com. Note that it's only available to those who have enabled the pin lock in the app. We highly encourage to enable that setting if you haven't done it yet.

The coin charts are now also available from the locks screen directly. Clicking on any coin will open the price charts and other detailed info about the coin.

### Other
Apart from the above there has been a lot of architectual improvements throughout the app. Mostly aimed at performance improvements. We believe it will continue to be this way until we reach version 1.

Peace!
