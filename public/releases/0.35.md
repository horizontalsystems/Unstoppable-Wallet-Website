BALANCE TAB REDESIGN, SEAMLESS DONATIONS, BUG FIXES

GM free souls! We are excited to bring you yet another update.

## 1. BALANCE TAB REDESIGN

We have redesigned the "Balance" tab to provide a more user-friendly and intuitive wallet experience. The balance tab now resembles the implementation of other popular wallet apps.

We hope these changes will make your experience with Unstoppable Wallet even better, and we look forward to hearing your feedback.

## 2. SEAMLESS DONATIONS

Nothing extraordinary here, we just changed the interface and implementation of the donate feature to make it better align with the app's overall aesthetics.

## 3. BUG FIXES

As always, we have addressed a lot of minor bugs for a better wallet experience.

Stay tuned for more updates as we strive to make our wallet the best it can be.

Enjoy and Peace!
