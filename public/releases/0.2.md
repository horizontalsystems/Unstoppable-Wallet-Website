## Decentralized Transaction Explorer

Enable wallet users to retrieve detailed transaction info (as a reference for the payment) from desired public blockchain explorer provider.

For every pending/past transaction in each supported blockchain the controller displays data returned by explorer i.e. transaction ID, number of confirmations, transaction fee, block where it was mined, relevant inputs/outputs for the given transaction and more.

That would allow wallet user to independently verify any incoming/outgoing transaction from within the client using external data provider. The implementation will enable user to choose which blockchain explorer to use from within the app.

## ERC 20 support + Coin Manager

Add support for ERC 20 tokens. Allow users to choose which currencies will appear on Balance Tab and hide those that are not needed. With the addition of ERC20 token there will be a lot.
