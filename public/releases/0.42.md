**3. NEW SECURITY FEATURES**

We‚Äôve enhanced protection against scams and phishing attacks. The app is now much better at identifying phishing transactions. You won‚Äôt see these transactions in your history, and the wallet will warn you if you try to send tokens to a suspicious address.

Moreover, when you send a transaction, the wallet cross-checks the recipient address against publicly available blacklists and sanctioned address lists, then alerts you if the address appears on any of them. It won‚Äôt block you from sending, but it‚Äôs a helpful measure to keep you informed in case you‚Äôre unknowingly interacting with a restricted address.


**4. NEW EVM CHAIN**

We‚Äôve added ZKsync chain support.


**5. FASTER TRANSACTIONS & IMPROVED EXPERIENCE**

- BTC, LTC, and BCH confirmations now require just 1 block for faster processing.

- Fresh App Icons ‚Äì Customize the look of your wallet.


**6. BUG FIXES & PERFORMANCE UPGRADES**

Enjoy general performance boosts for faster wallet syncing, plus bug fixes for a smoother user experience.

Stay tuned for even bigger things to come! Peace! ‚úåÔ∏è
