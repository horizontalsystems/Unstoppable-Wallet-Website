# Version 0.27 Highlights

NFT UPDATES, WALLET MANAGEMENT, ZCASH, UI IMPROVEMENTS, SOLANA PREPARATION

GM free souls! Most of the work in this sprint was aimed at addressing existing bugs, user interface improvements, and code refactoring.

---

## 1. NFT Improvements

This update brings the ability to send NFTs making the wallet fully NFT-ready. This Unstoppable Wallet has all NFT-related features from market analytics to sending/receiving.

## 2. Wallet Management

Unstoppable Wallet is now truly universal multi-wallet allowing anyone to create and/or restore any standard compliant wallet (with/out passphrases), even those created in other wallet apps.

## 3. ZCASH

ZCash library was updated to its latest version that addressed some of the known bugs.

## 4. UI IMPROVEMENTS

There were substantial UI improvements through the wallet app, covering dozens of screens.

## 5. SOLANA PREPARATION

In this sprint, we also started working on Solana integration which is currently in the development mode and for the most part complete. If all goes smoothly we expect it to be available in the app in version 0.28.

Enjoy and Peace!
