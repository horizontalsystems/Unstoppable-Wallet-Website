# Version 0.39 Highlights

MARKETS UPGRADE, WATCHLIST UPGRADE, DATA COLLECTION

Greetings, free souls! We're thrilled to introduce our latest update.

## 1. MARKETS UPGRADE

We've completely revamped the Markets tab with numerous enhancements across its sections. Notably, it now features an ETF tracker monitoring daily capital flows into Bitcoin ETFs.

## 2. WATCHLIST SIGNALS

Users can now view buy/sell signals next to listed coins on their watchlists. These signals leverage Bollinger Bands and RSI indicators for informed decision-making.

## 3. UI/UX DATA COLLECTION

Introducing an option to toggle anonymous app usage tracking. By default, this feature logs screen views without collecting identifiable or financial data.

Peace out!
