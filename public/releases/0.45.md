# 🚀 Version 0.45 

**MORE UPGRADE, MAYA PROTOCOL, WALLETCONNECT WHITELIST, STELLAR DAPP CONNECT, ZCASH SDK**

Privacy coins, decentralized swaps, and security upgrades - this release pushes all three fronts forward

**1. MONERO IMPROVEMENTS 🔒**

Monero (XMR) support just leveled up with a major upgrade.

- View Monero keys in Wallet Manager
- Watch-only XMR wallets by View Key
- Add memos (local address labels)
- Incoming transactions now show “To” address
- Subaddresses
- Significantly faster sync speed
- New “trusted” parameter for Monero nodes* 

* Only via trusted nodes, Unstoppable will display incoming pending transactions. All recommended nodes are trusted by default.

**2. MAYA PROTOCOL INTEGRATION 🌉**

A new cross-chain swap provider is here. Alongside Thorchain, Unstoppable now supports Maya Protocol - bringing DASH swaps with BTC, ETH, USDT, and more.

Zcash (ZEC) support via Maya is coming in the next release. XMR coming right after that!

**3. WALLETCONNECT WHITELIST ⭐️**

Huge security upgrade for interacting with dApps.

Every WalletConnect session is now checked against a vetted whitelist of trusted apps. If the app isn’t on the list (as in spoofing attempts), you’ll get an alert before signing.

**4. STELLAR DAPP CONNECT 🌐**

Added support for dApp connections on Stellar – expanding WalletConnect functionality to Stellar-based apps.

**5. ZCASH SDK UPDATE ⛓**

The Zcash SDK was upgraded to the latest release for improved performance..

**6. MOVING FORWARD WITH THE NEW DESIGN 🎨**

Our biggest UI overhaul in years continues. The new design is now expanded across more sections of the app - smoother, faster, and more consistent.

**7. BUG & CRASH FIXES 🛠**

All reported issues since the last release have been addressed for a more stable experience.

Peace!
