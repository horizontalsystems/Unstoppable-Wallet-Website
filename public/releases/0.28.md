# Version 0.28 Highlights

BITCOIN WALLET MANAGEMENT, BITCOIN ADDRESS WATCH, EVM WALLET MANAGEMENT, SOLANA PROGRESS

GM free souls! This sprint mostly focused on upgrading wallet management for Bitcoin and Ethereum chains. We wanted to cover all possible cases for existing Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets.

---

## 1. BITCOIN WALLET MANAGEMENT UPGRADE

Unstoppable Wallet is now a truly universal multi-wallet and at the same time likely the most comprehensive non-custodial Bitcoin wallet around. Not only are users now able to create/restore standard-compliant Bitcoin wallets but also export existing wallets to Unstoppable using any of the following:

- Mnemonic phrase (with/out passphrase)
- BIP32 Root Key
- Account Extended Private Key

Special thanks go to a number of users pushing us to extend the wallet to cover those use cases ;)

## 2. BITCOIN ADDRESS WATCH

Bitcoin hodlers keeping sats on cold storage devices (i.e. Ledger, Trezor etc) are now able to watch their balance in read-only wallets without exposing their private keys.

## 3. EVM WALLET MANAGEMENT

Wallet users on Ethereum and other EVM chains can now export existing wallets to Unstoppable using EVM Private Key. Previously EVM wallet export was limited to mnemonic phrases.

## 4. SOLANA PROGRESS

We are still working on integrating the Solana chain. Stay tuned.

Enjoy and Peace!
