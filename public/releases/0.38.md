GM Free Souls! We're thrilled to introduce Unstoppable Wallet version 0.38. As usual, we bring some major enhancements in this release!

## 1. MAJOR BITCOIN UPGRADE

Bitcoin wallets within Unstoppable received substantial enhancements:

- users are now able to speed up / cancel pending Bitcoin transactions.

- advanced and/or privacy-conscious users can control which Bitcoin UTXOs are used for transactions.

- users are now able to view previously used addresses for incoming Bitcoin payments.

- finally, there is an option to add public on-chain notes (memos) to outgoing Bitcoin payments.

The abovementioned improvements also apply to other Bitcoin-like blockchains i.e. Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.

## 2. TOKEN ANALYTICS ENHANCEMENTS

- AI-powered buy/sell signal based on technical analysis
- token smart contract analysis

## 3. WATCHLIST ENHANCEMENTS

Tokens in the watchlist can now be sorted based on price performance over various periods i.e. day, week, or month.

## 4. TRANSACTIONS FILTER

Transactions tab filtering options now include an option to filter outgoing payments by payment contacts. This allows someone to easily visualize all payments made to specific addresses/contacts.
