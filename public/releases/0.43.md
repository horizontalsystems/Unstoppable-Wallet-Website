# ðŸš€ Version 0.43 Highlights â€” New Chain, Smarter Tools, and Better UX!

Weâ€™re about to roll out one of our biggest updates yet â€” packed with powerful features that make Unstoppable even more private, capable, and unstoppable:

**1.  THORCHAIN SWAP INTEGRATION**

Cross-chain swaps are coming! Swap BTC â†” ETH (and more) directly inside the wallet. No KYC. No centralized exchanges. Full privacy preserved.

**2. ZCASH UPGRADE**

The wallet will now display both shielded and unshielded (t-address) Zcash balances.

Got unshielded coins? Shield them instantly with one tap.

**3. APP REBRANDING**

New colors, fonts, and UI components - Unstoppable is getting a fresh new look!

**4. STELLAR BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORT**

Full support for Stellar blockchain and its entire asset ecosystem - right inside your wallet.

**5. IMPROVED TOKEN PERFOMANCE METRICS**

Benchmark any asset, not just in USD, but also against BTC, Gold, S&P 500, or any top 50 token. See how your holdings truly perform over the various periods.

**6. ADDRESS CHECKER (SANCTIONS, BLACKLIST)**

New on-demand address checking section will let you scan any address against blacklists any time you need it. If you frequently send or receive large sums from third parties, this is a must-have.

**7. MARKETS IMPROVEMETS**

Token search is getting much smarter: filter 15K+ tokens using multiple criteria across any timeframe (1 week to 5 years).

Want to see which coins in the top 250 outperformed ETH over the last 6 months? Done in seconds.

Plus, youâ€™ll be able to view all trading pairs for any token across tracked exchanges, and filter by market type (DEX only / CEX only).
